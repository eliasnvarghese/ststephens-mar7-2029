"Hi there,

We run a YouTube growth service, which increases your number of
subscribers both safely and practically. 

- We guarantee to gain you 700+ new subscribers per month.
- People subscribe because they are interested in your videos/channel,
increasing video likes, comments and interaction.
- All actions are made manually by our team. We do not use any
'bots'.

The price is just $60 (USD) per month, and we can start immediately.

If you'd like to see some of our previous work, let me know, and we
can discuss it further.

Kind Regards,
Amelia"
