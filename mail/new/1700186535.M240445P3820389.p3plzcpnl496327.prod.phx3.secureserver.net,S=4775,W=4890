You have been contacted by Enid Delatte, and the message is as
follows.

"Hi ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

It's Enid and I just ran across your site at ststephenssanjose.org...

I found it after a swift search, so your search engine optimization is
working out…

Information looks decent…

One thing’s missing though…

A RAPID, CONVENIENT way to connect with you IMMEDIATELY.

Because data show that a potential customer like me will only linger a
few seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost immediately, Browse Click
Surf… then gone forever.

I have the solution:

Lead Conversion Tool is a tool that’s functions on your website,
ready to grab any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number.
You'd know right away they’re engaged and you can call them
immediately to TALK with them - really while they’re still on the
internet looking at your website.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to experience a Live Demo
with Lead Conversion Tool now to see just how it works and even give
it a try… it could be big for your enterprise.

Moreover, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation pronto… which is so powerful, because linking up with
someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more effective than
waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you follow up frequently with new
offers, content links, even just check-in notes to forge a
relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is extremely straightforward to
implement, cost-effective, and beneficial.
