"Hi to the ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

It’s Jacklyn here, with a brief message about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I am on the internet a lot and I look at a lot of business websites.

Like yours, a number of them have great content.

But, too often, they come up short when it comes to engaging and
connecting with someone who visits.

I comprehend – it’s tough. Research reveal 7 out of 10 persons who
visit a site, abandon it in minutes without even leaving even a trace.
You got the eyeball, but nothing.

Here is a remedy for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool  that’s operates on your site, set
to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.
You’ll know immediately they are interested and you can call them
direct to talk with them really whilst they’re still online looking
at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to check out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads today to see precisely how it functions.

It can be massive for your business – and as you’ve got that phone
number, with our new SMS Text With Lead capability, you may instantly
start a text (SMS) conversation – immediately… and connecting with
someone in that 5 minute window is 100 times more powerful than
contacting 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging you can follow up later with new promotions,
content links, or even just follow up notes to maintain the
conversation going.

Everything I’ve just mentioned is incredibly easy to apply,
affordable, and beneficial.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can offer for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more eyeballs into leads as we speak!

Jacklyn
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
features International Long Distance Calls. 
You have customers eager to speak with you at this moment… don’t
keep them waiting.
