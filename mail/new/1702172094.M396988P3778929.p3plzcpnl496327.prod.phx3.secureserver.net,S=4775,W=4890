"Salutations ststephenssanjose.org Manager.

This is Lemuel and I just found your website at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I found it after a brief search, so your SEO’s working out…

Content looks good…

One thing’s missing though…

A QUICK, EASY way to connect with you IMMEDIATELY.

Because studies show that a potential customer like me will only stay
a few seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost instantly, Click Surf
Surf… then disappeared.

I have the solution:

Visitor Engagement Widget is a software that’s operates on your
website, set to collect any viewer’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You will know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them immediately to CHAT with them - actually while they’re
still on the web looking at your website.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to test a Live Demo with
Lead Conversion Tool now to see exactly how it works and even test it
out… it could be massive for your enterprise.

Additionally, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new
SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation right away… which is so powerful, because getting in
touch with someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more
effective than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you follow up consistently with
new offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to forge a
relationship.

All I’ve just described is extremely simple to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.
