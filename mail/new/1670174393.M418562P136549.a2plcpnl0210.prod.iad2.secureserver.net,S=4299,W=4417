"Dear Madam/Sir,

Do you have a business? Wanted to create an engaging video for your
website? If the answer is YES, then I'm in the right place. 

My name is David and I work for VideosSoftwareClub. 

I’m mailing you because I found your site: ststephenssanjose.org,
and was wondering if you are interested in adding a cinematic video
for your website and marketing campaign? If you are not the person to
contact I would be very grateful if you could pass this message to
them.

Aside from cinematic video. Here are some of the video styles I
create:

Logo Animation Video

Social Media Video

Product Showcase Video

If you are interested please let me know, and if none of them speak to
your imagination I do many other styles as well, so please do reach
out to me personally.

Cinematic video is a video that resembles a film. Over the years, the
movie industry changed quite a lot in terms of aspect ratio, colour,
and lighting styles. When we use the term “cinematic,” this means
it looks like an actual film we see in theatres. Attract experts with
quality cinematic content head over to www.videossoftwareclub.com
