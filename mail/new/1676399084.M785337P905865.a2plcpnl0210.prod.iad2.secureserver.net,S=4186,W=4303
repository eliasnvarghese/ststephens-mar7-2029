"Dear Madam/Sir,

How are you? Hope you fine on this sunny day.

My name is David and I work for VideosSoftwareClub. 

Iâ€™m mailing you because I found your site: ststephenssanjose.org,
and was wondering if you are interested in adding a social media video
for your marketing campaign? If you are not the person to contact I
would be very grateful if you could pass this message to them.

Aside from social media video. Here are some of the video styles I
create:

Logo Animation Video

Cinematic Video

Product Showcase Video

If you are interested please let me know, and if none of them speak to
your imagination I do many other styles as well, so please do reach
out to me personally.

If you want to learn more about our service, simply click

Social media video is basically any video content that you create and
share through social networks. Those videos can be regular posts, ads,
Stories, cover videos, profile videos, or even comments on social
posts. The idea is to encourage your audience to engage with your
business and remember it.
