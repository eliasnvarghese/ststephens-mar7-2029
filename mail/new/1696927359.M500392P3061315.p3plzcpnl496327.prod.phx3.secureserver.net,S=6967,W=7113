"Salutations ststephenssanjose.org Manager

Henrietta here with a brief thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m across the internet quite a bit and I look at many business
websites.

Similar to yours, several them have great content.

But more often than not, they come up short when it comes to
interacting and connecting with anyone who visits.

I realize – it’s hard. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who land on
a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace. You got
the eyeball, but nothing else.

There’s a solution for you…

Lead Capture is a software widget that’s works on your site, set to
capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number.
You’ll know instantly they’re interested and you can call them
directly to chat with them literally while they’re still on the web
looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to test a Live Demo with Instant
Engagement Tool now to see exactly how it works.

It might be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – right away… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more potent
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers,
content links, even just follow-up notes to continue the conversation
going.

All I’ve just described is extremely easy to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to learn what Web Visitors Into
Leads can do for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Henrietta
PS: Lead Capture offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes
International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers waiting to talk with you immediately… don’t
keep them waiting.
