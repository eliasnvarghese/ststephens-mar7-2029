You have been contacted by Chu Oxenham, and the message is as follows.

"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Manager.

This is Chu here with a brief thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m throughout the internet frequently and I observe many business
websites.

Similar to yours, several them have fantastic content.

But frequently, they come up short when it comes to engaging and
connecting with anyone who visits.

I realize – it’s hard. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who land on
a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace. You got
the eyeball, but nothing else.

I have a solution for you…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s functions on
your site, prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address,
and Phone Number. You’ll know instantly they’re interested and you
can call them directly to speak with them literally while they’re
still on the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to test a Live Demo with
Web Visitors Into Leads now to see precisely how it works.

It can be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
immediately start a text (SMS) conversation – immediately… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more powerful
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Moreover, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers,
content links, even just follow-up notes to continue the conversation
going.

Everything I’ve just described is extremely straightforward to
implement, cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to discover what Instant
Engagement Tool can do for your business.

You might be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Chu
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers waiting to talk with you immediately… don’t
keep them waiting.
