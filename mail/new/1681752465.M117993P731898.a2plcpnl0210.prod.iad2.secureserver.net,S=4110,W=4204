"[url=http://xdstore.pro] A fundamentally new anti-detection browser
with anti-detection methods[/url] 
 
 
 
Ximera's work is based on the principles of cryptography, which make
it possible to confuse digital fingerprints and prevent
websites from collecting and compiling information about the activity
of their visitors. 
 
 
In addition to the obvious advantage of providing anonymous and secure
online activities, Chimera has other advantages: 
 
- Profile data can be stored in a convenient way for you. The choice
is a database or your own device. 
- Data on different devices are synchronized with each other. 
- The possibility of fairly accurate manual settings â€“ you can
change the proxy settings, time zone, browser identification string
and others. 
- Access to create multiple work environments. 
- Protection of the system from hacking if the password is entered
incorrectly. 
- Data encryption on a one-way key 
 
Anonymous browser is suitable for both private and corporate use with
the distribution of roles between participants. 
Install and enjoy protected viewing with anti-detection options.
