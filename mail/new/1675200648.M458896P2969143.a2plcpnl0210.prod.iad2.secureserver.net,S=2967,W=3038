"Happy Tuesday!

I want to be totally transparent. I know you are super busy delivering
your services. I took a look at your website and noticed you don't
have a way to capture contact information of clients or prospective
clients on your website. I would love to show you how you can easily
do that with ManyChat. And what is great is that it integrates with
Facebook messenger! I have created a free guide for you on how this
works. Just go to the webpage below to download the guide to see how
simple this is.
