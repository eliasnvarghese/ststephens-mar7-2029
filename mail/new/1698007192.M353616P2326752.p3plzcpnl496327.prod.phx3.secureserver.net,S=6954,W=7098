You have been contacted by Adan Bent, and the message is as follows.

"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Owner!

This is Adan here with a short thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m across the internet frequently and I examine a lot of business
websites.

Similar to yours, many them have fantastic content.

But more often than not, they come up short when it comes to
interacting and linking with someone who visits.

I realize – it’s hard. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who land on
a site, abandon it in moments without leaving a trace. You got the
eyeball, but nothing else.

There’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them directly to talk with them actually while they’re still on
the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Lead
Capture now to see exactly how it works.

It might be enormous for your business – and because you’ve got
that phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
automatically start a text (SMS) conversation – instantly… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more potent
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Moreover, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers,
content links, even just follow-up notes to continue the conversation
going.

Everything I’ve just described is very simple to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to learn what Instant Engagement
Tool can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Adan
PS: Instant Engagement Tool offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers eager to talk with you at this moment… don’t
keep them waiting.
