You have been contacted by Eric Jones, and the message is as follows.

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Administrator. Eric here with a quick
thought about your website ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m on the internet a lot and I look at a lot of business websites.

Like yours, many of them have great content. 

But all too often, they come up short when it comes to engaging and
connecting with anyone who visits.

I get it – it’s hard.  Studies show 7 out of 10 people who land on
a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace.  You got
the eyeball, but nothing else.

Here’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  You’ll know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them directly to talk with them literally while they’re still
on the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://blazeleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with
Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

It could be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
automatically start a text (SMS) conversation – immediately… and
contacting someone in that 5 minute window is 100 times more powerful
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers,
content links, even just follow up notes to keep the conversation
going.

Everything I’ve just described is extremely simple to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable. 
 
CLICK HERE https://blazeleadgeneration.com to discover what Web
Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Eric
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it

You have customers waiting to talk with you right now… don’t keep
them waiting.
