You have been contacted by Rosemary McGeehan, and the message is as

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

My name’s Rosemary, I came across ststephenssanjose.org after
performing a swift search – you popped up near the peak of the
rankings, so whichever you’re doing for SEO, looks like it’s
operating well.  

So here’s my query – what happens AFTER someone reaches on your
site?  Anything?

Studies tell us at least 70% of the individuals who locate your site,
after a fast once-over, they disappear… forever.

That signifies that all the labor and effort you put into getting them
to arrive, goes the tubes.

Why would you want all that excellent work – and the fantastic site
you’ve constructed – go to waste?

Because the probabilities are they’ll just omit over calling or even
pulling out their phone, leaving you high and dry.

But here’s a idea… what if you could formulate it super-simple for
someone to raise their hand, say, okay, let’s talk without needing
them to even pull their cell phone from their pocket?
  
You can – all thanks to innovative new software that can actually
make that first call happen NOW.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that sits on your site,
set and waiting capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It enables you be aware IMMEDIATELY – so that you can talk
to that lead while they’re still present at your site.
  
You realize, strike when the iron’s hot!

When targeting leads, you HAVE to act fast – the difference between
connecting with someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later is

well… once you’ve grabbed the phone number of the website visitor,
you can instantly kick off a text message (SMS) conversation with
them. 

Imagine how strong this could be – even if they don’t accept you
up on your offer instantly, you can stay in touch with them using text
messages to make new offers, offer links to excellent content, and
create your credibility.

Just this alone could be a game changer to render your website even
more productive.
