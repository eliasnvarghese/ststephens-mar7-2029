"Elon Musk was star guest this year at an annual conference organized
by Italian PM Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party. 
[url=https://kraken-vpn.net]2krn.nl [/url] 
He arrived against the backdrop of an ice-skating rink and an ancient
castle in Rome with one of his 11 children to tout the value of
procreation. 
 
Italy has one of the lowest birth rates in the world, and Musk urged
the crowd to “make more Italians to save Italy’s culture,” a
particular focus of the Meloni government.

Meloni has been a strong opponent of surrogacy, which is criminalized
in Italy, but there was no mention of Musk’s own recent children
born of surrogacy. 
 
The owner of X (formerly called Twitter) was slightly rumpled with
what could easily be argued the least stylish shoes in the mostly
Italian crowd since Donald Trump’s often unkempt former top adviser
Steve Bannon appeared at the conference in 2018. 
Meloni sat in the front row taking photos of Musk, who she personally
invited. Meloni founded the Atreju conference in 1998, named after a
character in the 1984 film “The NeverEnding Story.”"
