"hi there!

It's been a while since our last conversation, but I recently stumbled
upon something online about ststephenssanjose.org and thought it
important to reach out.

Knowing how fast misinformation can spread and wishing not you to be
taken by surprise, I felt the need to inform you.

know!

Best wishes,
Arletha
