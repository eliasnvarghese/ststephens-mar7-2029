"Dear Business Owner,

I’m thrilled to offer you an exciting opportunity that will put your
business on the map - literally! In just 10 minutes, I can have your
business listed on Google Maps. 
Here is your invite link https://linktr.ee/invitelink

You won’t have to pay a dime until I send you the Google Maps link
and show you that your business is indeed listed.

Not only will I list your business name and phone number, and more.
Normally, this service costs $1,000, but today, I’m offering it to
you for just $250 !

You won’t have to pay until your business is verified on Google
Maps. I’m proud to say that I’m the only person worldwide who can
offer this service. I’ll save you a lot of time and stress - no need
to worry about address verification or domain verification. I can list
your business at any address you want, under any name, anywhere in the
world.

Please call me on whatsapp
