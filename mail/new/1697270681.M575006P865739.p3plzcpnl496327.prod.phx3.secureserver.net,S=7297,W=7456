"To the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator!

I'm Georgina and I just recently found your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - in the searches.

Here is what that means to me…

Your SEO’s doing its job.

You’re receiving eyeballs – mine.

Your content’s pretty good, would not change a thing.

BUT…

Eyeballs do not pay the invoices.

CUSTOMERS do.

And surveys reveal that 7 out of 10 visitors to ststephenssanjose.org
will drop by, have a look, and then leave without doing else.

It’s like they never were even there.

You can resolve this.

You can make it extremely easy for them to raise their hand, say,
“okay, let’s talk” without demanding them to even so much as
pull their cell phone from their pocket… due to Visitor to Lead
