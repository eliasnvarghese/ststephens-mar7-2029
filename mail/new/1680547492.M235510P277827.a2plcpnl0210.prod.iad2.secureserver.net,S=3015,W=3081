You have been contacted by Ira Turner, and the message is as follows.

"Hi, my name is Ira Turner. Is your business still running? If so, you
might be aware of the Government's PPP Program where qualifying
businesses received funds to help them retain their employees as a
part of the CARES Act.
Well, that program has been expanded so more businesses qualify and
can receive potentially up to $26,000 PER W-2 EMPLOYEE, and you DO NOT
have to pay it back.

To find out how much your business potentially qualifies for, just go
to this website - http://RefundsNow.org and take 1 minute to fill out
the simple initial inquiry form to see what your business qualifies to
receive.

If you have any questions or would like for me to help you submit your
application, just call or text me at 888-400-8898.
Again, that website is http://RefundsNow.org"

You can contact Ira Turner via email, focken.britney@outlook.com
