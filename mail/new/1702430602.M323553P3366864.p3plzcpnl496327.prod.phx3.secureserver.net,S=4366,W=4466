"Hi to ststephenssanjose.org Owner.

I’m Ernest, and I recently came across your site,
ststephenssanjose.org.

Your site is got a lot going for it, but I’ve got an idea to make it
even MORE effective.

Check out Web Visitors Into Leads – CLICK HERE
https://advanceleadgeneration.com for a live demo right now.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a widget which is operates on your site,
prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. This tool notifies you the instant they let you know they’re
interested – meaning that you can talk to that lead whilst they’re
literally browsing your site.

Plus, once you’ve got their phone number, with our new SMS Text With
Lead function, you can instantly start a text (SMS) chat… and if
they don’t agree on your offer then, you can follow-up with text
messages for new offers, content links, or even just “how you
doing?” notes to build a relationship.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to discover what Web
Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

The gap between reaching out to someone in 5 minutes compared to a
half-hour implies you might be converting up to 100X more leads now!

Ernest
PS: Studies show that 70% of a site’s visitors leave and are gone
forever after just a moment. Don’t keep losing them. 
Web Visitors Into Leads gives a FREE 14 days trial – and it even

You have customers eager to chat with you right now… don’t leave
them waiting.
