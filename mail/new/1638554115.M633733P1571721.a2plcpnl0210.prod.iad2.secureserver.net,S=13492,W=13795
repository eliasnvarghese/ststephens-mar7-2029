You have been contacted by contactfikuxb, and the message is as
follows.

"Dear Madame, Dear Sirs! 
 
Sending newsletters via  forms of Your messages into the "Contact us"
section to the sites of companies via any countries of the world.  
 
https://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/ 
 
WHAT IS THE MAILING OF WEBSITES BY FEEDBACK FORMS? 
This is a type of mailing using the contact forms that are located in
the contact section of the website and filled by our programme in
automatic mode with a rate of a few thousand contact forms per 1
minute, while the alphanumeric code from the pictures (captcha) is
also solved. 
After that, the e-mails including your cooperation offers are sent to
the e-mails of organisations. 
When sending mailing by contact contact forms, it turns out that each
internet resource sends a correspondent e-mail “to itself” and,
therefore, all letters arrive in the inbox folder of the exact e-mail
in which the organisation is ready to receive the business
information. 
 
Unique Trade Offer: 
Fast 100% notification of businesses and site owners about new
business offers. 
Search of new customers that other advertisements cannot find. 
 
THE MAIN AIM: 
Finding customers that cannot be found through other types of
advertisements. 
 
Benefits: 
1.one hundred % delivery of cooperation messages. 
2.Increase of the customer database. 
3. Increase of the market share. 
4.Mailings based on topics and regionality. 
5. Sending letters to directors. 
6. Supply/demand analysis. 
7. Conducting marketing campaigns. 
8. Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. 
9. Notification speed. 
10. Cost. 
11. Entering the markets of other countries. 
 
Our competitive advantages: 
 
1.When sending mailing by feedback forms, all letters arrive in the
inbox. When sending bulk e-mails, this can reach up to 5%. 
 
2.When sending mailing by feedback forms it is possible to send a few
million messages per 24 hours to inboxes. When sending e-newsletters a
few thousands arrive in the inboxes, the rest often either are not
delivered or arrive in the junk folder. 
 
3. When sending mailing by contact forms a message does not get
blocked by mail services because it is sent from different sites. When
sending e-newsletters it is possible to send a few thousands of those
but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is done
will be banned. 
 
4. When sending mailing by feedback forms the minimum of
macro-synonims is used to form headings and text of the letter. When
sending e-mail newsletters, it is necessary to use synonyms
(«macros») for each word and create thousands different headings. 
 
5. Many businesses try to hide their e-mail address and only leave a
contact form for contacting with them. 
 
6. When sending bulk e-mails, your cooperation offer can be delivered
to every employee of the firm, (which causes irritation) compared to
mailing by feedback forms where the letter is received at the
electronic address specifically set up for commercial offers. 
 
7.Fifty % of corporate e-mails are located on free e-mail servers,
they are badly "searchable" by electronic address, but when sending
mailing by contact forms through these mail systems, all letters are
100% delivered to the recipients. 
 
8. Only thirty-forty % of businesses get into the directories within
2-3 years, and the rest are already located in our WHOIS databases and
are waiting for your commercial offers. 
It turns out that that emails of businesses from directories are
filled with spam, and therefore they will not have such result as when
sending mailing by contact forms using our always new WHOIS databases.

 
9. Any kind of stop words in the headings or body of the letter can be
sent through forms. When sending e-newsletters, such messages either
do not reach the recipient or arrive in spam. 
The list of stop words of mails includes almost all phrases and words
that encourage potential customers to take actions. 
 
Application: 
 
1. Increasing the customer base. 
2. Quick informing of marketplaces about new commercial offers. 
3. Reaching out directors. 
4.demand analysis. 
5. Conducting tenders. 
6.Conducting marketing campaigns. 
7.Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. 
8. Searching for clients abroad. 
 
Reasons for ordering this service: 
 
1. 100% delivery of your messages and business offers to millions of
firms all over the globe. 
Every website sends a letter to itself so all filters of mails are
bypassed. 
 
2.Mailing by feedback forms is an excellent way in for conducting
various marketing researches, studies and surveys of  social opinion
on differenttype of activity and direction. 
When sending mailing by feedback forms, you will will be absolutely
sure that your letter has been delivered to 100% of consumers of your
service and product and if a service or product is "poorly promoted",
then the potential issue lies in in something else, for example in
pricing. 
At the same time, within a week you will see demand for your products
and services, you will not have to spend money on renting premises and
other more expensive and time-consuming marketing events. 
 
3.Mailing by feedback forms is the most economical and quickest way to
get your product or service to the markets of other countries. 
 
4. Mailing by contact forms is a great tool for conducting all sorts
of tenders. 
 
5.Daily update of the database, as more than 150,000 new sites, are
registered all over the world daily, and you, get new potential
clients. 
 
6. Full geographical coverage for all states of the globe. 
 
7. We offer customers that are not available through other types of
advertisement. 
When sending mailing by contact forms, you will be able to get to that
part of your customers, that is impossible to "break through" in
automatic mode in any other way. 
For instance, you will be able to send a business offer to those
potential customers that were earlier unavailable due to filters of
mail systems while sending e-mail newsletters. 
In reality, there is a unusual situation: businesses in the
directories are literally spammed with all sorts of business offers
while very little or no e-mails are sent to the remaining ones. 
 
8. Unique technology of unraveling the captcha. 
There are special services for decrypting alphanumeric code
(captcha/CAPTCHA). It costs 1 dollar to solve 1000  captchas. 
It follows from this that, processing one million sites the robot
solves a million CAPTCHAs, which costs thousand $ only to solve
captcha/CAPTCHA, and with our service this is free of charge for you!

 
9. By ordering mailing by feedback forms, you are promoting your
product or service not to separate people, but to entire
organisations, for example domain .com, where more than one hundred
and fifty million cooperational  firms from all countries are
collected (we have got samples of them from international zones for
every state). 
 
10. Mailing by contact forms is also a subtype of text mailing 
Mailbox that is linked to the feedback form is the primary email of
businesses through which orders and commercial offers are sent. This
mail is also set up for cell phones as it is necessary to respond to
the information very fast so as not to misplace the order or the
relevance of the cooperation offer. 
 
11. The database of every country also includes all joint firms from
all countries working with or closely related to this country, for
instance, diasporas and national communities. 
Sanctions of mail systems and search engines? 
These mailings are an alternative to sending mass e-mails, therefore
search sanctions and "BAN" do not apply to them. 
The mail system delivers the data of e-mails to the inbox folder, as
it bypasses through the "warm e-mail channel" from the new IP address
of the website to the corporate e-mail of the same site. 
In other words, these mailings "live in emails" and filters of mail
systems do not respond to them, because mail systems have a certain
trust in communication channels between websites and corporate
e-mails. 
 
OUR DATABASES: 
 
You can buy our databases separately from the mailing by sending us a
enquiry by feedback form. 
 
MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND WHOIS DATABASES BY DOMAINS AND COUNTRIES. 
 
SELECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CONTINENTS OF THE WORLD. 
 
COLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN LANGUAGES. 
 
COLLECTIONS OF DATABASES BY THE MAIN CMS. 
 
SELECTIONS BY THE MAIN COUNTRIES. 
 
HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER FOR MAILING BY CONTACT FORMS: 
The simplest text + headings, the main goal is to interest the future
client, and they will read the rest on your website. 
Most likely, all ads on your subject are already on the networks,
enter the necessary requests into the search bar and choose the most
successful ones. 
The headings are substituted one after another from text file. 
Only text messages are sent, links are inserted without problems, they
are active. If the potential customer needs pictures or more specific
information, then you should forward the future customer to visit your
website. 
 
In the letter: 
Text without pictures, since pictures do not pass through the feedback
form.
