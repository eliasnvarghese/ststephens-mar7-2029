You have been contacted by Thomas M. Normert, and the message is as
follows.

"Hi,

If you been in business for more than 2 years and have over 5 W-2
employees, you might be eligible to get money back from the IRS.

This is what Travis Mellish Co-Owner of College H.U.N.K.S Hauling Junk
& Moving said about us:

“The Government Programs that are part of the Cares Act, can be very
daunting and confusing to understand. Our franchisees were getting a
lot of mixed messages and we were looking or a firm that could help
educate them and guide them through the process. Bottom Line was
extremely patient and diligent working individually with most of the
franchisees to maximize their money during the pandemic. They were a
great partner and we look forward to a long-lasting relationship.”

Give us a chance, to explain new IRS program.
