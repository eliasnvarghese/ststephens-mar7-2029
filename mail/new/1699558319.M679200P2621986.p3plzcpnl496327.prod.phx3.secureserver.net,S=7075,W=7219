"Salutations ststephenssanjose.org Owner

It's Gaye here with a quick thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m on the internet a lot and I examine numerous business websites.

Similar to yours, a number of them have great content.

But more often than not, they come up short when it comes to engaging
and linking with someone who visits.

I realize – it’s difficult. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who
arrive at a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace.
You got the eyeball, but nothing else.

I have a solution for you…

Lead Capture is a software widget that’s works on your site,
prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know right away they’re interested and you can call
them directly to speak with them actually while they’re still on the
web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to test a Live Demo with Lead
Capture now to see precisely how it works.

It might be massive for your business – and because you’ve got
that phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – instantly… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more effective
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Additionally, with text messaging you can follow up later with new
offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to maintain the
conversation going.

Each aspect I’ve just described is very easy to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to find out what Lead Capture can do
for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Gaye
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers eager to talk with you immediately… don’t keep
them waiting.
