You have been contacted by Denny Hitt, and the message is as follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster. this is Eric and I ran across
ststephenssanjose.org some moments ago.

Appears great…  now what?

What I mean is, once someone like myself discovers your website –
either by a Search or simply bouncing around – what happens next?
Are you getting a lot of leads from your site, or at least enough to
make you happy?

To be honest, most business websites fall a bit short when generating
creating paying customers. Studies show that 70% of a site’s
visitors vanish and are gone forever  only a moment.

Here is an idea…

How about making it really EASY for every visitor who comes to get a
personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…

You can do this –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, ready to grab every visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It signals you the minute they make you know they’re
interested – so that you can chat to that lead while they’re
literally browsing your site.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to experience a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads now to understand exactly how it works.

You will be surprised - the contrast between reaching out to someone
within 5 minutes compared to a half-hour or more later can increase
your results 100-fold.

It becomes even better… after you’ve captured their phone number,
with our new SMS Text With Lead function, you can instantly start a
text (SMS) discussion.

That way, even if you don’t close a deal instantly, you can stay
connected with text messages for new offers, content links, even just
“how you doing?” notes to create a relationship.

Pretty sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to discover what Web
Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads as we speak!

Eric
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads gives a FREE 14 days trial – and it even

You have customers waiting to talk with you right now… don’t leave
them waiting.
