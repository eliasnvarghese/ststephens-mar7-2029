You have been contacted by Oma Samuels, and the message is as follows.

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Admin

This is Oma and I just ran across your site at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I found it after a brief search, so your SEO’s working out…

Material looks good…

One thing’s missing though…

A QUICK, EASY way to communicate with you IMMEDIATELY.

Because studies show that a visitor like me will only stay a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 vanish almost instantly, Browse Browse Surf…
then gone forever.

I have the remedy:

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your
website, ready to capture any viewer’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. You will know right away they’re intrigued and you can
call them directly to TALK with them - really while they’re still on
the internet looking at your website.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works and even test it
out… it could be huge for your business.

Additionally, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new
SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation immediately… which is so strong, because getting in
touch with someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more
productive than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you keep in touch regularly with
new offers, content links, even just check-in notes to develop a
relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is incredibly easy to implement,
cost-effective, and beneficial.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to discover what Visitor Engagement
Widget can do for your business, possibly converting up to 100X more
viewers into leads now!

Oma
PS: Lead Conversion Tool offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even
includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have clients waiting to talk with you now… don’t keep them
waiting.
CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try Lead Conversion Tool now.

Merely a brief remark - the monikers and email address applied here,
Oma and Samuels, are stand-ins and not actual contact information. We
appreciate openness and desired to assure you’re aware of this! If
you wish to make contact with the genuine entity responsible for this
communication, do go to our website, and we’ll link you with the
proper individual.
