You have been contacted by Dorothy Hise, and the message is as

"Hi ststephenssanjose.org,

Did you know…

237 million people in the world practice the Law of Attraction?

But only 0.1% of these people actually manifest what they desire.

Ask yourself:

What do the 0.1% know that I don’t?

More importantly,

What will you manifest right now if you somehow found out what they
know?

Your dream home?

Dream car? …Vacation? …Partner? Maybe your dream body?

Well, 

A top-secret CIA “wealth attraction” experiment (funded by elite
billionaires) has discovered a new…

…7-minute at-home ritual to activate the wealth code within you:
https://www.kagrowth.org/billionaire .

✅ Attract extra money into your life effortlessly TODAY

✅ Heal your body quickly without medicine  

✅ Find the love you’ve been searching for years 

This neuroscientist taking this top secret information public, is
being hailed as the man of Christ by folks who are cash-strapped,
confesses that you can achieve all of the above rapidly if you just
hear the special soundwave revealed on this website here:
https://www.kagrowth.org/billionaire .

But I urge you to NOT delay checking it out because 

The investors that funded this research know about this website and
they are currently hiring the best Manhattan lawyers to…  

…shut this site down and silence the rogue scientist, so their
secret for manifesting wealth can’t be revealed to the normal
public.

They’ve already succeeded twice.

This might be your last chance to manifest and materialize all your
desires in just 7 minutes a day: https://www.kagrowth.org/billionaire
.

My students are reporting this begins working the first time you try
it.
