"Hi,

According to recent reports, digital ad spend in the world is
projected to reach US$271.20bn by the end of 2023. This means there
are ample opportunities for publishers like you to carve out their own
little piece of this pie. 

But, monetizing your website effectively through ads is easier said
than done. Platforms like Google AdSense come with a lot of
restrictions and formats that aren’t that versatile.
That’s where Monetag comes in. Even corporate websites also monetize
their blog parts through Monetag.

Monetag is one of the largest audience monetization platforms for
publishers. The best thing is that most Monetag ad formats are
compatible with AdSense (except Popunder/OnClick ads).

The platform works for every type of audience, including desktop,
mobile, and in app audiences. You get access to worldwide advertisers,
clean ads, competitive CPMs, and convenient payment options. 

Income growth is exciting, and the wait is worth it. During the first
month, advertisers typically test the quality of website traffic and
collect demographic data of website visitors at low bids; In the
second month, advertisers raise their bids once a week to compete for
ad placements on your site; In the third month, the advertisers
increased their bids significantly each week! You will earn $5 to $10
per 1000 page views via Monetag, Monetag brings publishers like you
more income than AdSense usually does !
