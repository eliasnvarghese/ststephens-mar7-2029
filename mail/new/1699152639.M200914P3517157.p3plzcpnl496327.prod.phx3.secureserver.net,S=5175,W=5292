"ststephenssanjose.org Owner, Greetings! I have just found your
website, quick question…

 name’s Dusty, I located ststephenssanjose.org after performing a
quick searching – you showed up near the top of the search rankings,
so whatsoever you’re doing for SEO, looks like it’s operating
well.

So here’s my question – what transpires AFTER somebody lands on
your website? Anything at all?

Research shows us at least 70% of the persons who find your site, post
a rapid look-over, they vanish… permanently.

This implies that all the effort and attempt you put into making them
to arrive, goes down the drain.

Why in the world would you desire all of that excellent work and
effort – and the excellent website you’ve built – go to waste?

As the odds are they’ll just skip over calling up or even pulling
out their phone, leaving you high and dry.

But, here’s a thought for you… what if you could make extremely
simple for someone raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk about
it” without requiring them to even pull their cell phone from their
pocket to groundbreaking new software can literally make that first
ever call happen NOW.
