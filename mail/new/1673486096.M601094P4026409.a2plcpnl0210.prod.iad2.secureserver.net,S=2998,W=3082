You have been contacted by Neal Dane?, and the message is as follows.

"Dear Business Owner:

Was your business affected by the pandemic like most of us?

If so, there is a program called ERC that allows us to claim up to
$26,000
In tax credits per qualified W-2 employee.

It was passed as part of the CARES ACT in 2020 and was meant to assist
the business
owners with retaining employees. 

Unfortunately, most business owners don’t know it exists which is
why we are trying to
get the word out.

The good news is that it’s pretty easy to qualify for and can result
in a very significant check
From the IRS.

If you’d like to find out if your business qualifies, click the link
below to complete our short
ERC Questionnaire and we will reach out to discuss options.

Thanks
