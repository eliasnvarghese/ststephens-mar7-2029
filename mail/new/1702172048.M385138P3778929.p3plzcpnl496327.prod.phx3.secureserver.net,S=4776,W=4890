You have been contacted by April Langan, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Admin.

This is April here with a short thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m across the internet quite a bit and I look at numerous business
websites.

Just like yours, many them have excellent content.

But more often than not, they come up short when it comes to engaging
and connecting with someone who visits.

I get it – it’s difficult. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who
arrive at a site, abandon it in moments without leaving any trace. You
got the eyeball, but nothing else.

There’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know instantly they’re interested and you can call
them directly to talk with them literally while they’re still on the
web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to test a Live Demo with
Instant Engagement Tool now to see precisely how it works.

It can be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
automatically start a text (SMS) conversation – immediately… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more effective
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Moreover, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers,
content links, even just follow-up notes to maintain the conversation
going.

All I’ve just described is extremely straightforward to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

Engagement Tool can do for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

keep them waiting.
