12 Tips on How to Stage Your Home for a Quick Sale

1. Clean
A clean home shows potential buyers that you've taken good care of the
property. Ideally, you should clean every part of the house, from the
floors to the ceilings—and everything in between.

2. Declutter
There are two major problems with clutter. One is that it distracts
buyers from your home's features. The other is that it makes it seem
like the home has less space.

3. Depersonalize
Buyers need to be able to envision themselves in your home, so remove
all the family photos, keepsakes, and refrigerator art. Keep clothes
hidden away as much as possible, and make sure the bathroom counters
are empty (except for hand soap, of course). Likewise, put away all
the toys and anything else that is highly personal or evocative of the
home's current inhabitants.

4. Focus on Fresh
A few potted plants can do wonders to make your home feel fresh and
inviting. If you have a lot of plants, space them out strategically so
they don't overwhelm any one area (unless you have a greenhouse). Of
course, dead and dying plants don't do much to make your home look
well tended.

5. Define Rooms
Make sure that each room has a single, defined purpose. And make sure
that every space within each room has a purpose. This will help buyers
see how to maximize the home's square footage. If you have a finished
attic, make it into an office. A finished basement can become an
entertainment room, and a junk room can be transformed into a guest
bedroom.

6. Wallpaper and Paint
It is unlikely that a potential buyer will like your wallpaper. Your
best bet is to tear it down and paint the walls with a neutral color
instead. It's best not to paint over the wallpaper because it may look
shabby and send a signal to the buyer about work they may have to do
later.

7. Flooring
No one wants to live in a home with dirty, stained carpet, especially
when someone else was the one who dirtied it. And linoleum is outdated
and looks cheap. Although pricey, hardwood floors add value and
elegance to a home. They are also low maintenance, provide great
long-term value, and are perfect for buyers with allergies. In other
words, they appeal to almost everyone, and if not, they're easily
carpeted over by the buyer and preserved for the next owner.

8. Lighting
Take advantage of your home's natural light. Open all curtains and
blinds when showing your home. Add fixtures where necessary, and turn
on all the lights for showings (including those in the closets). This
makes your home appear brighter and more inviting, and it saves buyers
from having to hunt for light switches. If you think your existing
fixtures are fine, be sure to dust them and clean off any grime.
Otherwise, outdated and broken light fixtures are easy and cheap to
replace.

9. Furniture
Make sure furniture is the right size for the room, and don't clutter
a room with too much of it. Furniture that's too big will make a room
look small, while too little or too small furniture can make a space
feel cold.

10. Walls and Ceilings
Cracks in the walls or ceiling are red flags to buyers because they
may indicate foundation problems. If your home does have foundation
problems, you will need to either fix them or alert potential buyers
to them; fixing any foundation problems would be better in terms of
getting the home sold. If the foundation only looks bad but has been
deemed sound by an inspector, repair the cracks so you don't scare off
buyers for no good reason.

11. Exterior
The exterior and the entryway—which factor into the home's "curb
appeal"—are important points of focus because they can heavily
impact a buyer's first impression. They may even determine someone's
interest in viewing the inside of the house.

12. Final Touches
Just before any open house or showing, make sure that your staging
efforts have the maximum impact with a few last-minute touches that
will make the home seem warm and inviting. Put fresh flowers in vases,
let fresh air into the house for at least ten minutes beforehand so it
isn't stuffy, light a few candles (soft and subtle fragrances only),
and put new, plush towels in the bathrooms.
