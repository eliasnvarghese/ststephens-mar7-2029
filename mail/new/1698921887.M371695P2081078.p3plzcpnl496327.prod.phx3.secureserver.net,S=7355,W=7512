"Howdy to ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster!

This is Trent and I just came across your site - ststephenssanjose.org
- through the search results

So here’s what that means to me…

Your SEO’s doing its job.

You’re attracting eyeballs – mine at least at least.

Your content’s pretty good, wouldn’t change a single thing

BUT…

Eyeballs do not pay the bills.

CUSTOMERS do

And studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors to a site to a site like
like ststephenssanjose.org will visit, look around, and then depart
without doing anything anything else.

It’s like they never were even there.

You can fix this this.

You can make it it super-simple for them to raise their hand say,
“okay, let’s talk” without requiring them them to even pull
their cell phone from their pocket thanks to Web Visitors Into Leads.
