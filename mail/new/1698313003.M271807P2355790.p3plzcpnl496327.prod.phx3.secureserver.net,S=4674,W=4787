You have been contacted by Willis Gibbs, and the message is as
follows.

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Manager

This is Willis here with a quick thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m throughout the internet a lot and I look at numerous business
websites.

Just like yours, a number of them have excellent content.

But frequently, they come up short when it comes to connecting and
linking with someone who visits.

I get it – it’s hard. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who visit a
site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace. You got the
eyeball, but nothing else.

There’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them directly to speak with them really while they’re still on
the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Lead
Capture now to see specifically how it works.

It might be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
automatically start a text (SMS) conversation – instantly… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more potent
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Additionally, with text messaging you can follow up later with new
offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to maintain the
conversation going.

All I’ve just described is extremely simple to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to discover what Lead Capture can do
for your business.

You might be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Willis
PS: Lead Capture offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes
International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers waiting to talk with you immediately… don’t
keep them waiting.
