"Cool website!

To the ststephenssanjose.org Owner!

My name’s Lucinda, and I recently found your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - while navigating the net. You surfaced at the
peak of the search results, so I looked you out. Appears like what
you’re doing is pretty cool.  

But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me comes
across ststephenssanjose.org, what normally happens?

Is your site producing leads for your company? 

I’m guessing some, but I also bet you’d like more… studies show
that 7 out 10 who arrive on a site wind up leaving without a trace.

Not good.

Here’s a notion – what if there was an simple way for every
visitor to “raise their hand” to get a phone call from you
INSTANTLY… the moment they hit your site and stated, “call me
now.”

You can –
  
Web Visitor is a software widget that’s operates on your site, set
to grab any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.  It lets
you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can chat to that lead while
they’re really looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitor now to see specifically how it works.

Time is money when it comes to connecting with with leads – the
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be huge – like 100 times better!

That’s why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead feature…
because once you’ve caught the visitor’s phone number, you can
automatically start a text message (SMS) conversation.
  
Think about the possibilities – even if you don’t close a deal
then and there, you can follow with text messages for new offers,
content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to build a
relationship.

Wouldn’t that be cool?

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to discover Web Visitor can do for
your business

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
Lucinda

PS: Web Visitor offers FREE 14 days trial – and it even comprises
Long Distance Calling. 
You have customers waiting to to talk with you right now… don’t
keep them waiting.

Merely a quick note - the monikers and email address utilized in this

behind this message, kindly visit our website, and we’ll connect you
with the proper individual.
