You have been contacted by Georgina Sifford, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator!

I am Georgina and, unlike many emails you might get, I wish to instead
provide you with a word of commendation – Kudos!

For what?

Part of my job is to examine websites and the work you have done with
ststephenssanjose.org absolutely is notable.

It is clear you took building a website to heart and invested a real
commitment of time and resources into making it high quality.

Nonetheless, there is, however… to be more precise, a question…

So, when someone like me finds your site – perhaps on top of the
search results (nice job BTW) or just through a random link, how can
you tell?

Even more importantly, how do you make a connection with that person?

Research reveal that 7 out of 10 visitors don’t stick around –
they are there one second and then gone with the wind.

Here’s a way to create IMMEDIATE engagement that you may not have
known about…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a widget widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It lets you know IMMEDIATELY that they’re interested – so
that you can speak to that lead while they’re literally browsing
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads today to understand precisely how it operates.

It might be a transformative change for your business – and it turns
even better… after you’ve collected their phone number, with our
new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text
(SMS) chat – immediately (and there’s actually a 100X difference
between reaching out to someone within just 5 minutes versus 30
minutes.)

Moreover then, even if you don’t seal a deal right away, you can
connect later on with text messages for fresh deals, content links,
even just follow up notes to create a relationship.

All I have just mentioned is easy, easy, and effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can offer for your business.

You can be turning up to 100X more leads today!

Georgina
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads gives a FREE 14 days trial – and it even
