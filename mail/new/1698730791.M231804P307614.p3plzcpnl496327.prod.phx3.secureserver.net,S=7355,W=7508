You have been contacted by Sallie Bulcock, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Owner.

This is Sallie and, unlike numerous emails you may receive, I wanted
to alternatively provide you with a word of praise – Well done!

What for?

Part of my job is to check out websites and the work you have done
with ststephenssanjose.org absolutely is notable.

It’s clear you took building a website seriously and invested a real
investment of time and resources into making it top quality.

However, there is, however… to be more precise, a question…

Thus, when someone like me finds your site – maybe at the top of the
search results (well done BTW) or just through a random link, how can
you tell?

More importantly, how can you make a connection with that person?

Data show that 7 out of 10 visitors leave – they are there one
second and then gone with the wind.

Here is a way to create IMMEDIATE engagement that you may not have
known about…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool widget that’s functions on your
site, ready to capture every visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It allows you know INSTANTLY that they are interested – so
that you can chat to that lead while they are actually looking at
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it functions.

It might be a transformative change for your business – and it
becomes even better… once you have collected their phone number,
with our new SMS Text With Lead function, you can instantly start a
text (SMS) discussion – immediately (and there’s literally a 100X
difference between connecting with someone within 5 minutes compared
to 30 minutes.)

Moreover then, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can
associate later on with text messages for new promotions, content
links, even just follow up notes to create a relationship.

All I have just outlined is easy, simple, and effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads right now!

Sallie
