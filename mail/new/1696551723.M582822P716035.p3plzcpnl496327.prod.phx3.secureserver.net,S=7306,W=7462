You have been contacted by Tahlia Dyal, and the message is as follows.

"Hi ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

I am Tahlia and I recently discovered your webpage -
ststephenssanjose.org - in the searches.

Here is what that means to me…

Your SEO’s doing its job.

You’re getting eyeballs – at least mine.

Your content’s pretty good, would not change a thing.

BUT…

Eyeballs don’t pay the invoices.

CUSTOMERS do.

And surveys show that 7 out of 10 visitors to a site to
ststephenssanjose.org will drop by, have a look, and then depart
without doing anything else.

It’s like they never were even there there.

You can fix this.

You can make it extremely easy for them to show interest, say,
“okay, let’s talk” without needing them to even so much as pull
their cell phone from their pocket… thanks to Lead Conversion
Software.

potent… you’ve got their number, so now you can begin a text
message (SMS) conversation with them with them… so even if if they
don’t take you up take you up on your offer immediately, you
continue to text them to text them them new offers, new content, and
new reasons to do business with you to do business with you.

This could change everything change everything for you and your
company.
