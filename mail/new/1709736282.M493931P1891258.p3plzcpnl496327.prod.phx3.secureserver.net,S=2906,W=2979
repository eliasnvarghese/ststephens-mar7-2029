"Howdy!

It's been some time since we last communicated, but I recently
stumbled upon something online about ststephenssanjose.org and thought
it important to reach out. 

It seems like there's some unfavorable news that could be detrimental.

Understanding how fast misinformation can spread and wishing not you
to be unprepared, I felt the need to notify you.

Here's where I came across the info:

I hope it's all a simple confusion, but it seemed prudent you should
know!

Wishing you all the best,
Eloisa
