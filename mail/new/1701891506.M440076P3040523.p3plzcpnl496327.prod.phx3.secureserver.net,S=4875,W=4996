"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

This is Cassie and I stumbled upon ststephenssanjose.org a moment ago.
 

Appears great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone such as me discovers your website –
either through Searching or just bouncing around – what happens
next?  Do you get numerous of leads from your site, or at least enough
to make you pleased?

Frankly, most business websites fall a bit short when it comes to
generating paying customers. Studies indicate that 70% of a site’s
visitors leave and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…
 
How about making it really STRAIGHTFORWARD for every visitor who shows
up to get a personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your
site…
 
You can –
  
Web Conversion is a software widget that’s works on your site, ready
to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.  It
signals you the moment they inform you they’re interested – so
that you can chat to that lead while they’re really looking over
your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with
Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

You’ll be amazed - the difference between contacting someone within
5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could boost your results
100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text
(SMS) conversation.
  
That way, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can
continue with text messages for new offers, content links, even just
how you doing? notes to build a relationship.

Quite sweet – AND effective.
