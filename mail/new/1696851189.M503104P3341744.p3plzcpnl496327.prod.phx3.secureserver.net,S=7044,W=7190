"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

I'm Lauren and I recently discovered your website at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I located it after a brief search, so your SEO’s working out…

Information looks good…

One thing’s missing though…

A FAST, SIMPLE way to get in touch with you RIGHT NOW.

Because research show that a visitor like me will only stay a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost immediately, Click Browse
Browse… then disappeared.

I have the remedy:

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, set to collect any viewer’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You will know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them directly to SPEAK with them - really while they’re still
on the web looking at your website.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try out a Live Demo with Visitor
Engagement Widget now to see exactly how it works and even give it a
try… it could be big for your business.

Plus, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS Text
With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS) conversation
right away… which is so strong, because getting in touch with
someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more effective than
waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you follow up consistently with
new offers, content links, even just follow up notes to build a
relationship.

All I’ve just described is extremely easy to implement,
cost-effective, and lucrative.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to learn what Visitor Engagement
Widget can do for your company, possibly converting up to 100X more
eyeballs into leads right now!
