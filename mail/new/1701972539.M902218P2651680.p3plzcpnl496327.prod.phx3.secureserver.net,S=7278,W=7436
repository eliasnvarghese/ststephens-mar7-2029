You have been contacted by Dino Vandermark, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

Great website!

 name’s Dino, and I recently discovered your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - when surfing the net. You popped up at the
very top of the search results, so I checked you out. Looks like what
you’re doing is really interesting.

But just in case you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me
stumbles across ststephenssanjose.org, what typically happens?

Does your site generating leads for your business?

I’m assuming some, but I also assume you’d love more… research
suggest that 7 out 10 who land on a site end up leaving without
leaving any trace.

That's not ideal.

Here is a thought – what if there's an effortless way for each
visitor to signal interest to get a phone call from you INSTANTLY…
the second they visit your site and expressed, “call me now.”

Well, you can –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a application widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It lets you be informed IMMEDIATELY – so that you can chat
to that lead while they’re actually looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to check out a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads now to understand exactly how it
functions.

Timing is crucial when it comes to reaching out to leads – the
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later is huge – like 100 times better!

And that's why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead feature…
because once you’ve grabbed the visitor’s phone number, you can
instantly start a text message (SMS) discussion.

Imagine about the opportunities – even if you don’t seal a deal
then and there, you can follow up with text messages for new
promotions, content links, or even just “how you doing?” notes to
establish a relationship.

Wouldn’t that be cool?

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to learn what Web
Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads right now!
Dino

PS: Web Visitors Into Leads provides a FREE 14 days trial – and it
also includes International Long Distance Calling.

them waiting.
