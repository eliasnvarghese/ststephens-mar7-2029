You have been contacted by Danielle Simpson, and the message is as
follows.

"Hi,

We'd like to introduce to you our explainer video service, which we
feel can benefit your site ststephenssanjose.com.

Check out some of our existing videos here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWz-ELfJVEI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y46aNG-Y3rM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJCFX1AjHKk

All of our videos are in a similar animated format as the above
examples, and we have voice over artists with US/UK/Australian
accents. We can also produce voice overs in languages other than
English.

They can show a solution to a problem or simply promote one of your
products or services. They are concise, can be uploaded to video sites
such as YouTube, and can be embedded into your website or featured on
landing pages.

Our prices are as follows depending on video length:
Up to 1 minute = $259
1-2 minutes = $379
2-3 minutes = $489

*All prices above are in USD and include a full script, voice-over and
video.

If this is something you would like to discuss further, don't hesitate
to reply.

Kind Regards,
Danielle"
