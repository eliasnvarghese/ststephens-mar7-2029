You have been contacted by Margherita Dunningham, and the message is
as follows.

"Hi ststephenssanjose.org Owner.

Margherita here with a short thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m throughout the internet quite a bit and I examine numerous
business websites.

Like yours, several them have fantastic content.

But frequently, they come up short when it comes to interacting and
linking with anybody who visits.

I understand – it’s challenging. Studies show 7 out of 10 people
who land on a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a
trace. You got the eyeball, but nothing else.

There’s a solution for you…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them directly to chat with them actually while they’re still on
the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with
Instant Engagement Tool now to see specifically how it works.

It could be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – instantly… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more effective
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Additionally, with text messaging you can follow up later with new
offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to keep the
conversation going.

Each aspect I’ve just described is extremely simple to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to learn what Web Visitors
Into Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!
