"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Administrator!

This is Gabriela and I stumbled upon ststephenssanjose.org a moment
ago.  

Seems great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone like me discovers your website – either
through Searching or just bouncing around – what happens next?  Do
you get a lot of leads from your site, or at least enough to make you
happy?

Honestly, most business websites fall short when it comes to
generating paying customers. Studies reveal that 70% of a site’s
visitors disappear and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…
 
How about making it really SIMPLE for every visitor who comes to get a
personal phone call from they hit your site…
 
You can –
  
Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It signals you the moment they tell you they’re interested
– so that you can speak to that lead while they’re actually
looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see precisely how it works.

You’ll be astonished - the difference between contacting someone
within 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could boost your
results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text
(SMS) conversation.
  
That way, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can follow
up with text messages for new offers, content links, even just “how
you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

Quite sweet – AND effective.
