interested – meaning that you can talk to that lead as they’re
really browsing your site.

Moreover, once you’ve secured their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead capability, you can instantly start a text (SMS)
chat… and if they don’t agree on your offer then, you can
follow-up with text messages for fresh offers, content links, or even
just “how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.
