"
How can I remove unwanted calendar events that appeared after clicking
a malicious advertisement? I was downloading an unauthorized copy of a
cartoon show when I accidentally clicked on an ad that redirected me
to a suspicious website. Since then, my calendar has been filled with
events for every hour of the next two days, and I cannot delete them.
The delete option is not available for these events. I have attached
some screenshots of the problem.
