"Hi ststephenssanjose.org Owner!

My name is Eric and I’m betting you’d like your website
ststephenssanjose.org to generate more leads.

Here’s how:
Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It signals you as soon as they say they’re interested –
so that you can talk to that lead while they’re still there at
ststephenssanjose.org.

Web Visitors Into Leads – CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com for
a live demo now.

And now that you’ve got their phone number, our new SMS Text With
Lead feature enables you to start a text (SMS) conversation – answer
questions, provide more info, and close a deal that way.

If they don’t take you up on your offer then, just follow up with
text messages for new offers, content links, even just “how you
doing?” notes to build a relationship.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to discover what Web Visitors
Into Leads can do for your business.

The difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus a
half-hour means you could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Try Web Visitors Into Leads and get more leads now.

Eric
PS: The studies show 7 out of 10 visitors don’t hang around – you
can’t afford to lose them!
