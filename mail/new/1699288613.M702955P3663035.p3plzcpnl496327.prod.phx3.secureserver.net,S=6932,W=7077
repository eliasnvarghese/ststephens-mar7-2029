follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Owner.

Stewart here with a brief thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m across the internet quite a bit and I observe a lot of business
websites.

Similar to yours, a number of them have excellent content.

But frequently, they come up short when it comes to connecting and
bonding with anybody who visits.

I get it – it’s hard. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who land on
a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace. You got
the eyeball, but nothing else.

Here’s a solution for you…

Lead Capture is a software widget that’s works on your site,
prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know instantly they’re interested and you can call
them directly to chat with them really while they’re still on the
web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try out a Live Demo with Lead
Capture now to see exactly how it works.

It could be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – immediately… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more powerful
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers,
content links, even just follow-up notes to maintain the conversation
going.

Everything I’ve just described is very easy to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to discover what Instant Engagement
Tool can do for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Stewart
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers eager to talk with you at this moment… don’t
keep them waiting.
