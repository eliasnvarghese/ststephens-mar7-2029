You have been contacted by Eric Jones, and the message is as follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster! 

My name is Eric and unlike a lot of emails you might get, I wanted to
instead provide you with a word of encouragement – Congratulations

What for?  

Part of my job is to check out websites and the work you’ve done
with ststephenssanjose.org definitely stands out. 

It’s clear you took building a website seriously and made a real
investment of time and resources into making it top quality.

There is, however, a catch… more accurately, a question…

So when someone like me happens to find your site – maybe at the top
of the search results (nice job BTW) or just through a random link,
how do you know? 

More importantly, how do you make a connection with that person?

Studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors don’t stick around –
they’re there one second and then gone with the wind.

Here’s a way to create INSTANT engagement that you may not have
known about… 

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It lets you know INSTANTLY that they’re interested – so
that you can talk to that lead while they’re literally checking out
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE http://advanceleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

It could be a game-changer for your business – and it gets even
better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation – immediately (and there’s literally a 100X
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes.)

Plus then, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can
connect later on with text messages for new offers, content links,
even just follow up notes to build a relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is simple, easy, and effective. 

CLICK HERE http://advanceleadgeneration.com to discover what Web
Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Eric
