You have been contacted by Flossie Pettit, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Manager!

My name is Flossie and, contrary to a lot of emails you may get, I
wish to rather provide you with a word of congratulations – Bravo!

What for?

Part of my job is to examine websites and the work you’ve done with
ststephenssanjose.org definitely is remarkable. 

It’s clear you have taken building a website to heart and made a
genuine investment of time and resources into making it top quality.

Nonetheless, there is, indeed, a question… more precisely, a
question…

So, when someone like me happens to find your site – possibly at the
top of the search results (nice job by the way) or just through a
random link, how do you find out?

More importantly, how do you make a bond with that person?

Studies reveal that 7 out of 10 visitors leave – they’re there one
second and then disappeared.

There’s a way to create PROMPT engagement that you may not have
known about…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. It allows you know INSTANTLY that they’re interested – so
that you can talk to that lead while they’re literally looking over
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Lead
Capture now to see specifically how it works.

It might be a significant improvement for your business – and it
gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text
(SMS) conversation – immediately (and there’s really a 100X
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes.)

Additionally then, even if you don’t close a deal instantly, you can
connect later on with text messages for new offers, content links,
even just follow-up notes to forge a relationship.

Each aspect I’ve just described is straightforward, convenient, and
efficient.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Flossie
PS: Lead Capture offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes
International Long Distance Calling.

them waiting.

you with the right person.
