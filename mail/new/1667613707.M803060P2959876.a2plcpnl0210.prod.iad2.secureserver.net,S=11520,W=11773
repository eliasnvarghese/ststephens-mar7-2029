The only way to really know is to look for the NSF Label on all your
supplement products. If it does nt have the NSF label, just say no!


What is an NSF facility / FDA Registered Facility and Why These are
Important?


Today, going to the store is not all about picking up what you need,
paying for it, and heading back home. You have to research and check
 the ingredients. Manufacturers are chasing sales and cutting losses
by using highly processed ingredients, some of which might have
adverse long-term effects.

Most companies are FDA-approved. But for brands that take extra
precautions and value the well-being and safety of their customers, 
for instance fixing brand alignment issues, NSF certification is the
gold standard. Only a handful of companies meet the requirements of
NSF certification, and ours is one of them. 

What is NSF? 

The National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) is a third-party testing and
validation foundation that has been in operation since 1944. The
foundation has grown
 in popularity among consumers and manufacturers because of its strict
measures and dedication to improving global human health.

While the FDA is highly regarded, the NSF is the GOLD STANDARD in
terms of consumer safety. Its standards help to protect food, water,
consumer 
products, and the environment through testing, auditing, and
certifying products and systems.

What is an NSF Facility? 

An NSF facility is any facility that has qualified and received NSF
certification. In some cases, you might notice facilities that claim
to have 
goods “tested to NSF standards.” This is not the same or equal to
having NSF certification. 

To have NSF certification, the facility needs to; 

Have their claims of reduced contaminants in their products and
production lines verified and proven.
Their systems must be tested to ensure they don’t add harmful
products to the water or foods that they process or handle.
The facility must have structurally sound systems that meet the
stringent measures and requirements of the NSF.
The advertising literature and labeling used in the products are
verified and accurate.
The materials and production processes are thoroughly tested to
guarantee quality products over time.
It is not enough that a brand claims to have products’ tested to NSF
standards’; these claims have to be verified. Vava’s nutritional
supplements are produced
 in an NSF-certified facility meaning all the claims like being
vegan-friendly, non-GMO, Cruelty-free, and organic are verified and
validated. Our customers have 
complete confidence in the value they get inside our supplement
bottles. 

How Do You Know If a Product and Facility is NSF Certified? 

Simple! All NSF-certified products and facilities carry the NSF mark.
The mark is a symbol of assurance the packaging claims are accurate
and work as expected. 

That means you no longer have to worry about going through the
confusing ingredients list, or the misleading marketing literature.
All you need to do is check for the NSF mark. 

Why is it essential for consumers to check for NSF certification?

With the rampant food safety outbreaks and recalls, taking care of
your body and guaranteeing the hygiene and care used to make consumer
products or foods is becoming harder. 

Brands are becoming more deceptive in a bid to increase market share,
and increasingly dangerous ingredients are finding their way into your
foods.

We understand that your health and overall well-being are your focal
points. That’s why all our supplements and health support products
are produced in an NSF-registered CGMP facility. Why is this
important? 

NSF-registered Facilities build trust
 
Consumer trust is at an all-time low. More than half of the customers
aren’t satisfied with the information available on product labels. 

One of the ways brands can build trust with their customers is by
including trusted certifications on their product packaging and
labeling. 

Being an independent public health organization, NSF is one of the
most credible sources, and its blue symbol is recognized globally. 

NSF Facilities are Health code compliant 

Healthy living is more than the food you eat. It’s also about the
appliances and products you use to prepare your food. Even though not
everything in your kitchen needs to be NSF certified, NSF certified
appliances meet and exceed the standards of quality and health set by
local, state, and federal health codes. 

For restaurateurs and other business operators that require frequent
inspection, the NSF certification mark is a quick hint to inspectors
of compliance and quality. 

The NSF symbol represents consumer protection 

The CDC estimates that over 48 million people contract foodborne
illnesses annually. Up to 128,000 of those require medical attention
in a hospital around 3,000 people die from such complications. 

These are bone-chilling numbers. Poorly designed equipment is mainly
to blame for the cross-contamination and endangering of millions of
lives.

The checks and balances done by the NSF are aimed to reduce the risk
of contamination by ensuring food-grade equipment and food produce are
handled in the proper environment using safety equipment. The NSF
symbol only appears on foods and consumer products that pass these
checks, meaning the chances of cross-contamination are lower.

Accuracy: You get what’s on the label

It’s common practice for brands to exaggerate what’s on offer.
Consumers are up in arms, taking drastic measures to adopt healthier
lifestyles. Brands take note of this and label their products
accordingly. As you might have noticed, in most cases, the labeling is
misleading.

With consumer products that carry the NSF symbol, the claims on the
labeling and packaging are verified and validated. If you buy bread
with a label indicating “made with real carrots,” then the bread
contains real carrots as an ingredient.

The NSF mark symbolizes truth and transparency in the claims on the
product label. 

The Takeaway 

Getting NSF certification is not easy. There is a ton of
qualifications and standards that have to be met. In some states,
it’s a requirement that specific equipment, especially those used in
the restaurant business, be approved and certified by NSF
International. There’s also a seven-step process that products must
pass through to meet the NSF criteria. 

Good health is your most valuable asset, and you should guard it
jealously. That’s why we find it necessary to go through the
stringent NSF measures to provide you with products that not only
support your body in being the best it can be but also made from the
best practices that are safe for the environment as well. 

Sorry guys, nothing to sell you in this email. Just education. Hope
You have a safe and happy hiliday season, and only buy supplements
form NSF approved facilities.
