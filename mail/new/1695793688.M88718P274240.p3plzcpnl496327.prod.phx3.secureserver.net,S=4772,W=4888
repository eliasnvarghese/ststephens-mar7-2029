"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Owner

My name’s Chana and I just found your site at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I located it after a quick search, so your search engine optimization
is working out…

Information looks pretty good…

However, one thing’s missing though…

A QUICK, EASY way to communicate with you RIGHT NOW.

Because research show that a visitor like me will only linger a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 leave almost instantly, Click Browse Click…
then gone.

I have the answer:

Visitor Engagement Widget is a software widget that’s functions on
your site, set to capture any viewer’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. You’ll know instantly they’re interested and you can
call them immediately to TALK with them - literally while they’re
still on the web looking at your website.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to experience a Live Demo with
Web Visitors Into Leads now to see just how it works and even give it
a try… it could be huge for your company.

Moreover, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text (SMS)
conversation immediately… which is so strong, because linking up
with someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more effective
than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you follow up regularly with new
offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to build a
relationship.

All I’ve just described is incredibly simple to implement,
cost-effective, and lucrative.
