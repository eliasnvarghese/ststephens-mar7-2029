You have been contacted by Carmella Freitas, and the message is as
follows.

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

It's Carmella and just for a moment, imagine this…

- An individual does a search and lands at ststephenssanjose.org.

- They linger for a moment to see.  I’m interested… but…
maybe…

- And then they press the back button and check out the other search
results alternatively. 

- Bottom line – you got an eyeball, but nada to show for it.

- And they’re gone.

This isn’t really your fault – it happens a LOT – studies show 7
out of 10 visitors to any site vanish without leaving a trace.

But you CAN fix that.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. It allows you know immediately – enabling you to call
that lead while they’re really viewing your site.

Lead Conversion Tool now to see exactly how it works.

Time is money when it comes to connecting with leads – the
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes compared to 30
minutes later can be huge – like 100 times better!

Moreover, now that you have their phone number, with our new SMS Text
With Lead feature you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation… so even if you don’t close a deal at that time, you
can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, or
even just how you doing? notes to build a relationship.

Effective stuff.
