You have been contacted by Rene Segura, and the message is as follows.

"If you're a business owner with at least two W2 employees... then
THIS is exactly what you're looking for.

I'd like to introduce you to apply-for-ertc.com

which helps you apply for the Cares Act Program in just a few
minutes!

apply-for-ertc.com makes it simple for you to:

> get free stimulus money you don't have to pay back...

> get the last 3 years of stimulus payments all at once...

> get quick approval...

> get up to 26 thousand per employee...

And what makes this even better?

Now you never have to worry about doing any of the number crunching or
figuring out how much money you qualify for!

Which also means you're not stuck feeling like this is too much
paperwork to sort out.

And best of all... you'll be done with apply-for-ertc.com in less than
2 minutes and it costs nothing to apply.

So again, if you're a business owner with at least two W2 employees,
understand this:

> this program will end soon...

> If you act now before April you can still claim the prior 3
years...

Go to apply-for-ertc.com
