You have been contacted by Eric Jones, and the message is as follows.

"Hi ststephenssanjose.org Administrator!

My name’s Eric and I just came across your website -
ststephenssanjose.org - in the search results.

Here’s what that means to me…

Your SEO’s working.

You’re getting eyeballs – mine at least.

Your content’s pretty good, wouldn’t change a thing.

BUT…

Eyeballs don’t pay the bills.

CUSTOMERS do.

And studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors to a site like
ststephenssanjose.org will drop by, take a gander, and then head for
the hills without doing anything else.

It’s like they never were even there.

You can fix this.

You can make it super-simple for them to raise their hand, say,
“okay, let’s talk” without requiring them to even pull their
cell phone from their pocket… thanks to Web Visitors Into Leads.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that sits on your site,
ready and waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and
Phone Number.  It lets you know immediately – so you can talk to
that lead immediately… without delay… BEFORE they head for those
hills.
  
CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/leadgenerationc to try out a Live Demo with
Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

Now it’s also true that when reaching out to hot leads, you MUST act
fast – the difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes
versus 30 minutes later is huge – like 100 times better!

That’s what makes our new SMS Text With Lead feature so powerful…
you’ve got their phone number, so now you can start a text message
(SMS) conversation with them… so even if they don’t take you up on
your offer right away, you continue to text them new offers, new
content, and new reasons to do business with you.

This could change everything for you and your business.

everything Web Visitors Into Leads can do and start turing eyeballs
into money.
