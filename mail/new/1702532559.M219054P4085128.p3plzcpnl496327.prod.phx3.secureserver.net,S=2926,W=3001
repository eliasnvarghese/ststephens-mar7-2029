"Hi webmaster of ststephenssanjose.org,

I'm going to share an incredible secret with you…
About an underground method of making cash from one of the world's
most popular phone apps…

A website that YOU probably use several times a day…

Anyone can use this method.

And it only takes a few minutes of 'work'.

This is a 100% risk-free opportunity.

But you must act fast as places are very limited and are filling up
FAST!
