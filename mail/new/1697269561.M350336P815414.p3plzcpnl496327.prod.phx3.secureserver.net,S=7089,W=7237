"To the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator. this is Eric and I ran
across ststephenssanjose.org some moments ago.

Seems great…  now what?

By that I mean, if someone such as myself discovers your website –
either through Search or just bouncing around – what happens next?
Are you get a lot of leads from your site, or  enough to make you
happy?

To be honest, most business websites fall a bit short in terms of
generating generating paying customers. Data show that 70% of a
site’s visitors disappear and are gone forever  only a moment.

Here is an idea…

How about making it really EASY for any visitor who shows up to get a
personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…

You can do this –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a widget  that’s operates on your site,
prepared to grab any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.
It signals you the minute they make you know they’re interested –
so that you can talk to that lead while they’re actually browsing
your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to check out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads today to understand exactly how it operates.

You will be astonished - the contrast between reaching out to someone
within 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could increase your
results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve grabbed their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text
(SMS) conversation.

Hence, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can keep in
touch with text messages for new offers, content links, or even just
“how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

Rather sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can provide for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Eric
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even comes with International Long Distance Calling. 
You have customers waiting to chat with you at this moment… don’t
keep them waiting.
