You have been contacted by Lavern Naquin, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator!

My name is Lavern and, unlike many emails you might get, I would like
to instead provide you with a word of encouragement – Well done!

For what?

Part of my job is to examine websites and the work you’ve done with
ststephenssanjose.org absolutely is notable.

It’s clear you took building a website seriously and made a real
investment of time and resources into developing it premium.

Nevertheless, there is, a catch… more accurately, a question…

Therefore, when someone such as myself discovers your site – perhaps
at the top of the search results (nice job BTW) or just through a
random link, how do you find out?

More importantly, how do you make a connection with that person?

Research reveal that 7 out of 10 visitors don’t stick around –
they are there one second and then gone with the wind.

Here is a way to create INSTANT engagement that might be new to
you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool  that’s operates on your site,
ready to capture every visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It lets you know IMMEDIATELY that they are interested – so
that you can chat to that lead whilst they’re literally checking out
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads today to see exactly how it functions.

It could be a game-changer for your business – and it becomes even
better… once you have collected their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead function, you can instantly start a text (SMS)
conversation – instantly (and there’s really a 100X difference
between connecting with someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Additionally then, even if you don’t seal a deal instantly, you can
associate later on with text messages for fresh offers, content links,
even just follow up notes to build a relationship.

All I’ve just mentioned is straightforward, easy, and effective.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to find out what Web
Visitors Into Leads can provide for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads right now!
