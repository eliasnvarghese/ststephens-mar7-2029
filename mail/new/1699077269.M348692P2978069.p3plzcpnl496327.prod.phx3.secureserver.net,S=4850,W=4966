"To the ststephenssanjose.org Admin. this is Eric and I ran across
ststephenssanjose.org a few minutes ago.

Seems great…  now what?

What I mean is, when someone such as myself finds your website – 
through a Search or simply bouncing around – what happens next? Do
you getting a lot of leads from your site, or at least enough to make
you happy?

To be honest, most business websites come a bit short in terms of it
comes to generating paying customers. Research indicate that 70% of a
site’s visitors leave and are gone forever after only a moment.

Here’s an idea…

Why not make it it really EASY for each visitor who shows up to get a
personal phone call you as soon as they hit your site…

You can do this –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a widget widget that’s functions on your
site, set to grab every visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It signals you the second they let you know they’re
interested – so that you can talk to that lead as they’re really
checking out your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads today to understand precisely how it works.

You will be surprised - the difference between connecting with someone
within just 5 minutes compared to a half-hour or more later could
increase your results 100-fold.

It becomes even better… once you’ve captured their phone number,
with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a
text (SMS) conversation.

Thus, even if you don’t seal a deal instantly, you can stay
connected with text messages for fresh offers, content links, even
just “how you doing?” notes to establish a relationship.

Pretty sweet – AND effective.

Leads can provide for your business.
