"To the ststephenssanjose.org Owner! it's Eric and I ran across
ststephenssanjose.org some moments ago.

Looks great… but now what?

I mean, when someone such as myself discovers your website –  by
searching or simply bouncing around – what happens next? Do you get
a lot of leads from your site, or  enough to make you happy?

Frankly, most business websites fall a bit short when it comes to
generating paying customers. Data indicate that 70% of a site’s
visitors vanish and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…

What about make it it really EASY for each visitor who arrives to get
a personal phone call you as soon as they hit your site…

You can do this –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software  that’s operates on your site,
prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It signals you the moment they make you know they’re
interested – so that you can speak to that lead while they’re
literally checking out your site.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads today to see precisely how it functions.

You will be surprised - the difference between connecting with someone
within just 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could increase
your results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text
(SMS) discussion.

Thus, even if you don’t close a deal instantly, you can keep in
touch with text messages for fresh deals, content links, even just
“how you doing?” notes to create a relationship.

Rather sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to discover what Web
Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads as we speak!

Eric
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads gives a FREE 14 days trial – and it even
comes with International Long Distance Calling. 
There are customers eager to talk with you at this moment… don’t
leave them waiting.
