"Why a rare image of one of Malaysia’s last tigers is giving
conservationists hope 
[url=https://me3ga-at.net]MEGA сайт[/url] 
Emmanuel Rondeau has photographed tigers across Asia for the past
decade, from the remotest recesses of Siberia to the pristine valleys
of Bhutan. But when he set out to photograph the tigers in the ancient
rainforests of Malaysia, he had his doubts. 
 
“We were really not sure that this was going to work,” says the
French wildlife photographer. That’s because the country has just
150 tigers left, hidden across tens of thousands of square kilometers
of dense rainforest.

“Tiger numbers in Malaysia have been going down, down, down, at an
alarming rate,” says Rondeau. In the 1950s, Malaysia had around
3,000 tigers, but a combination of habitat loss, a decline in prey,
and poaching decimated the population. By 2010, there were just 500
left, according to WWF, and the number has continued to fall. 
 
The Malayan tiger is a subspecies native to Peninsular Malaysia, and
it’s the smallest of the tiger subspecies in Southeast Asia. 
 
“We are in this moment where, if things suddenly go bad, in five
years the Malayan tiger could be a figure of the past, and it goes
into the history books,” Rondeau adds. 
 
Determined not to let that happen, Rondeau joined forces with
WWF-Malaysia last year to profile the elusive big cat and put a face
to the nation’s conservation work. 
 
It took 12 weeks of preparations, eight cameras, 300 pounds of
equipment, five months of patient photography and countless miles
trekked through the 117,500-hectare Royal Belum State Park… but
finally, in November, Rondeau got the shot that he hopes can inspire
the next generation of conservationists.

“This image is the last image of the Malayan tiger — or it’s the
first image of the return of the Malayan tiger,” he says."
