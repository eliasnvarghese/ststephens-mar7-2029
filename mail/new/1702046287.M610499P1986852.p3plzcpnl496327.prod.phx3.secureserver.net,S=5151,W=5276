You have been contacted by Miguel Ogle, and the message is as follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

My name is Miguel and, unlike many emails you may get, I wish to
alternatively provide you with a word of congratulations –
Congratulations!

What for?

Part of my job is to review websites and the work you’ve done with
ststephenssanjose.org certainly stands out. 

It’s clear you took building a website to heart and made a true
investment of effort into making it premium.

Nonetheless, there is, indeed, a catch-22… more precisely, a
question…

So, when someone like me happens to find your site – perhaps at the
top of the search results (nice job by the way) or just through a
random link, how do you know?

Moreover, how do you make a bond with that person?

Studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors don’t stick around –
they’re there one second and then disappeared.

I have a way to create IMMEDIATE engagement that you might not have
known about…

Lead Capture is a software widget that’s functions on your site,
ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. It lets you know IMMEDIATELY that they’re interested – so
that you can speak to that lead while they’re literally checking out
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to test a Live Demo with
Web Visitors Into Leads now to see specifically how it works.

It might be a significant improvement for your business – and it
gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text
(SMS) conversation – instantly (and there’s actually a 100X
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes.)

Additionally then, even if you don’t close a deal instantly, you can
follow up later on with text messages for new offers, content links,
even just follow-up notes to build a relationship.

All I’ve just described is straightforward, user-friendly, and
effective.

Engagement Tool can do for your business.

You might be converting up to 100X more leads today!
