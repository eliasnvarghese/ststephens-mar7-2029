"My name’s Eric and I just found your site ststephenssanjose.org.

It’s got a lot going for it, but here’s an idea to make it even
MORE effective.

Talk With Web Visitor – CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com for a
live demo now.

Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It signals you the moment they let you know they’re
interested – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re
literally looking over your site.

And once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text
With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation… and if they don’t take you up on your offer then,
you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links,
even just “how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to discover what Talk With Web
Visitor can do for your business.

The difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus a
half-hour means you could be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Eric
PS: Studies show that 70% of a site’s visitors disappear and are
gone forever after just a moment. Don’t keep losing them. 
Talk With Web Visitor offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even
includes International Long Distance Calling. 
You have customers waiting to talk with you right now… don’t keep
them waiting.
