"To the ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster

Victor here with a brief thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m throughout the internet a lot and I observe many business
websites.

Just like yours, a number of them have great content.

But more often than not, they come up short when it comes to
connecting and bonding with anybody who visits.

I realize – it’s difficult. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who
land on a site, abandon it in moments without leaving a trace. You got
the eyeball, but nothing else.

Here’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know right away they’re interested and you can call
them directly to chat with them literally while they’re still on the
web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Lead
Capture now to see exactly how it works.

It can be huge for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
automatically start a text (SMS) conversation – right away… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more powerful
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Additionally, with text messaging you can follow up later with new
offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to keep the
conversation going.

All I’ve just described is incredibly simple to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to find out what Lead Capture can do
for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Victor
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers ready to talk with you at this moment… don’t
keep them waiting.
