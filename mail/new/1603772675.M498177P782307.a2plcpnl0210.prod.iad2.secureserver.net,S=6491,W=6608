"Black Lives Matter - Donate 
Why We Need Your Support 
As our ecosystem grows our financial support system must grow as well.

We need funds to continue our radically accessible commitment to
providing healthy food from Black owned businesses, paid childcare at
every event and having ASL interpreters at our monthly gatherings. 
On average, our monthly open houses attract 3000+ people and costs us
$100,000. 
We need to raise $ 350,000 by November 3 to help thousands of black
people in a very bad situation right now, we will be glad if you
support us. 
For quick payment, we use bitcoin wallets. You can transfer donation
to this Bitcoin wallet - 12B6eCHqPVQeR8wyTTMoWQqNeTpxqeq7wk 
Secondly, we need resources to make sure we have the emotional and
spiritual capacity to show up and move forward in the movement as our
highest selves. 
Supporting the work of our healers including renting space weekly for
Black people to process racial stress through group discussion, dance,
and visual art and 
affirming our humanity & love for each other by starting our week with
joy via #BlackJoySunday (all while creating accessibility by offering
free childcare) 
is essential in sustaining our well-being and activism. Our weekly
healing spaces cost on average $30,150/month. 
We need to raise $ 350,000 by November 3 to help thousands of black
people in a very bad situation right now, we will be glad if you
support us. 
For quick payment, we use bitcoin wallets. You can transfer donation
to this Bitcoin wallet - 12B6eCHqPVQeR8wyTTMoWQqNeTpxqeq7wk 
Lastly and most importantly, we need funds to support the emerging
leadership of our ecosystem move through the world. 
As Black people in a city facing the ravages of displacement and
economic disinvestment, it’s difficult to do the work of liberating
your community while figuring out how to pay rent and feed yourself. 
We need your help to ensure that lack of gas money or health insurance
doesn’t stop the work from moving forward. Supporting our emerging
leadership, including our rapid response, 
organized resistance, healing and logistics teams, reimbursements and
stipends costs on average $20,700/month."
