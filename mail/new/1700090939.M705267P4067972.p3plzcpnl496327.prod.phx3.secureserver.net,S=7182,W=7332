"Greetings to the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator. it's Eric and I
discovered ststephenssanjose.org a little while ago.

Appears great…  now what?

By that I mean, when someone such as myself finds your website – 
through Search or simply bouncing around – what happens next? Are
you getting a lot of leads from your site, or at least enough to make
you happy?

Honestly, most business websites come a bit short when generating
generating paying customers. Studies reveal that 70% of a site’s
visitors vanish and are gone forever after only a moment.

Here is an idea…

Why not make it it really EASY for each visitor who comes to get a
personal phone call you as soon as they hit your site…

This is possible –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a widget  that’s works on your site,
prepared to collect any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It alerts you the minute they let you know they’re
interested – so that you can chat to that lead while they’re
actually browsing your site.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to experience a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads now to understand exactly how it
operates.

You will be surprised - the difference between connecting with someone
within just 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could enhance
your results 100-fold.

It turns even better… after you’ve captured their phone number,
with our new SMS Text With Lead capability, you can instantly start a
text (SMS) chat.

That way, even if you don’t seal a deal immediately, you can stay
connected with text messages for new offers, content links, even just
“how you doing?” notes to establish a relationship.

Quite sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to learn what Web
Visitors Into Leads can provide for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads as we speak!

Eric
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even features International Long Distance Calls. 
There are customers waiting to speak with you at this moment…
don’t keep them waiting.
