You have been contacted by Grant Lira, and the message is as follows.

"Hey,

I’ll get right to it. I can get you on 3 podcasts/mo, and get you 15
professionally edited short form videos for social media (from the
podcast interview), and then get you featured in 3 online
publications/mo all done for you.

We’ve helped 33 clients do just that to build their thought
leadership in their specific industry which has helped them:

- Generate more appointments
- Close at a higher rate (Because they built authority before the
sales call even started)
- Charge higher prices because people view their company as unique
now

Interested? We can chat here:

Best,
Grant

PS - I won’t see your response on here so if you have a question,
please book a call (:
