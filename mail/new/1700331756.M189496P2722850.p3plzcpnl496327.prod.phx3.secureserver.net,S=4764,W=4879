You have been contacted by Dolly Wingate, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Manager.

I'm Dolly and I just ran across your site at ststephenssanjose.org...

I found it after a quick search, so your search engine optimization is
working out…

Material looks decent…

One thing’s missing though…

A RAPID, CONVENIENT way to connect with you NOW.

Because studies show that a visitor like me will only stay a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost immediately, Browse Surf
Browse… then gone forever.

I have the solution:

Visitor Engagement Widget is a software widget that’s works on your
website, ready to grab any user’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You will know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them directly to CHAT with them - actually while they’re still
on the web looking at your website.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to experience a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works and even
give it a try… it could be huge for your enterprise.

Moreover, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation pronto… which is so strong, because getting in touch
with someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more effective
than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you follow up consistently with
new offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to develop a
relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is very easy to implement,
cost-effective, and lucrative.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to find out what Visitor
Engagement Widget can do for your business, possibly converting up to
100X more eyeballs into leads today!
