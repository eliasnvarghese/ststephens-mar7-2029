"Hello,

As someone who cares deeply about supporting employers, I believe that
when we invest in our employees' well-being, we all benefit. That's
why I'm excited to introduce our latest program that offers
comprehensive accident insurance to protect your employees from
unexpected hospital costs.

With coverage of up to $5000 per accident, our program provides the
financial security and peace of mind your employees need to focus on
their recovery and get back to work. Whether it's a fall, a biking
incident, or a playground injury, our accident insurance ensures that
your employees and their families won't be burdened by unexpected
medical bills.

At just $29 for individuals and $69 for families, this program is a
cost-effective way to show your employees that you prioritize their
health and safety. You can choose to cover the cost yourself, split it
with your employees, or let them cover it entirely. Signing up is easy
and takes only 20 minutes.

One of the best things about our program is that it can be used to
cover a deductible if your employees have health insurance, providing
even more value and support when they need it most.

By offering accident insurance, you demonstrate that you care about
your employees' well-being and are committed to providing a
supportive, caring workplace. This, in turn, can help boost employee
morale and foster a stronger company culture.

At YourSuccess, we've partnered with a leading company to design this
program, so you can feel confident that your employees are getting the
best possible coverage. If you have any questions or want to get
started, please don't hesitate to give us a call at 702-213-5945 or
email us at teamyoursuccess@gmail.com.

Thank you for considering our program. We're excited about the
opportunity to work with you and support your employees.

Best regards,

Stephanie
