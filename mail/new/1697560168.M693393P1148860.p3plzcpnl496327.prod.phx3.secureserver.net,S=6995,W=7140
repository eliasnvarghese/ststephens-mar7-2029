"Hi to the ststephenssanjose.org Owner.

This is Ken here, bringing you a brief thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I am throughout the internet quite a bit and I look at many business
websites.

Similar to yours, many them have excellent content.

Yet, more often than not, they lack when it comes to engaging and
forming a connection with anybody who visits.

I comprehend – it is tough. Reports reveal 7 out of 10 persons who
arrive at a site, abandon it in minutes without leaving even a trace.
You got the eyeball, but nothing else.

Here’s a answer for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool  that’s functions on your site,
prepared to collect any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. You will know instantly they’re interested and you could
call them directly to talk with them actually whilst they are still on
the internet looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to check out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads today to understand precisely how it works.

It can be massive for your business – and since you have got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead capability, you can
automatically start a text (SMS) discussion – right away… and
contacting someone in that 5 minute window is 100 times more effective
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Plus, with text messaging you may follow up later with fresh deals,
content links, or even just follow up notes to maintain the
conversation going.

Everything I’ve just mentioned is extremely straightforward to
apply, affordable, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to discover what Web Visitors Into
Leads can offer for your business.

You might be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads as we
speak!

Ken
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads gives a FREE 14 days trial – and it even

them waiting.
