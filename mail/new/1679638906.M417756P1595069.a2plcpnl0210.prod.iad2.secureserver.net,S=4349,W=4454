You have been contacted by Eric Jones, and the message is as follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Admin! my name’s Eric and I just ran
across your website at ststephenssanjose.org...

I found it after a quick search, so your SEO’s working out…

Content looks pretty good…

One thing’s missing though…

A QUICK, EASY way to connect with you NOW.

Because studies show that a web lead like me will only hang out a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost instantly, Surf Surf Surf…
then gone forever.

I have the solution:

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  You’ll know immediately they’re interested and you can
call them directly to TALK with them - literally while they’re still
on the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works and even
give it a try… it could be huge for your business.

Plus, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS Text
With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation pronto… which is so powerful, because connecting with
someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more effective than
waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you follow up regularly with new
offers, content links, even just follow up notes to build a
relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is extremely simple to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.
