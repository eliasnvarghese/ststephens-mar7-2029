follows.

"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Manager.

My name’s Francisca and I recently discovered your site at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I located it after a brief search, so your search engine optimization
is working out…

Material looks pretty good…

One thing’s missing though…

A RAPID, CONVENIENT way to get in touch with you IMMEDIATELY.

Because research show that a web lead like me will only linger a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost immediately, Click Surf
Browse… then disappeared.

I have the remedy:

Visitor Engagement Widget is a tool that’s operates on your website,
ready to grab any viewer’s Name, Email address, and Phone Number.
You’ll know instantly they’re engaged and you can call them
immediately to SPEAK with them - actually while they’re still on the
web looking at your website.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to experience a Live Demo
with Visitor Engagement Widget now to see precisely how it works and
even test it out… it could be big for your business.

Plus, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS Text
With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text (SMS) conversation
right away… which is so powerful, because getting in touch with
someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more effective than
waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you keep in touch regularly with
new offers, content links, even just follow up notes to develop a
relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is incredibly easy to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.
