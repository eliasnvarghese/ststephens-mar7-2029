"Salutations ststephenssanjose.org Manager!

I'm Marshall and I recently discovered your website at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I located it after a quick search, so your SEO’s working out…

Material looks good…

One thing’s missing though…

A FAST, SIMPLE way to communicate with you RIGHT NOW.

Because research show that a visitor like me will only hang out a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 vanish almost immediately, Browse Click
Surf… then gone forever.

I have the solution:

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your
website, set to collect any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know right away they’re intrigued and you can call
them immediately to SPEAK with them - actually while they’re still
on the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Lead
Conversion Tool now to see exactly how it works and even test it
out… it could be huge for your business.

Moreover, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation right away… which is so powerful, because connecting
with someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more efficient
than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you stay connected frequently with
new offers, content links, even just check-in notes to build a
relationship.

Every single thing I’ve just described is extremely simple to
implement, cost-effective, and beneficial.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to discover what Web Visitors Into
Leads can do for your company, possibly converting up to 100X more
visitors into leads right now!

Marshall

them waiting.

Simply a rapid note - the monikers and email address applied in this
note, Marshall and Jevons, are substitutes and not actually real
information. We value openness and desired to confirm you’re aware
of this! Should you wish to make contact with the genuine individual
responsible for this communication, kindly visit our website, and
we’ll associate you with the correct entity.
