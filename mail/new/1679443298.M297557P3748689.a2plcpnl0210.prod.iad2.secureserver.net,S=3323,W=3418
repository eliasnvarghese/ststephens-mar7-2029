You have been contacted by Neal Matlock, and the message is as
follows.

"I noticed your website isn’t ranking well in the search results. We
have the exclusive ability to have your company on Google’s
autocomplete for any search term you want. 

For example, if someone searches Personal injury lawyer Las Vegas then
Google will autocomplete the search to Learner and Rowe (Our client).
Or dentist San Antonio, Google will autocomplete the search to Stone
Oak (Our Client)

This means you’ll 
-	You’ll be taking over the search before users ever hit the search
result (huge traffic)
-	Get insane branding > looks like Google recommends you.

This service is called Search-Box-Optimization (SBO), which we provide
exclusively. 

*Important – the search terms are exclusive, meaning once you own
them, they are yours. 

*Important - You Only Pay When We Get You In The Auto- Complete. "Pay
For Results ONLY!"

You can see the magic of SBO in a video Here: https://reachkings.com
