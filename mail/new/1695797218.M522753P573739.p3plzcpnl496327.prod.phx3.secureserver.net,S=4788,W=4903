You have been contacted by Finley Hamm, and the message is as follows.

"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Manager

My name’s Finley and I recently discovered your website at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I located it after a swift search, so your search engine optimization
is working out…

Information looks decent…

However, one thing’s missing though…

A RAPID, CONVENIENT way to communicate with you NOW.

Because research show that a potential customer like me will only stay
a few seconds – 7 out of 10 leave almost immediately, Surf Browse
Browse… then disappeared.

I have the solution:

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s functions on
your website, ready to capture any viewer’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. You will know right away they’re interested and you
can call them directly to TALK with them - really while they’re
still on the internet looking at your website.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to try out a Live Demo with Lead
Conversion Tool now to see exactly how it works and even test it
out… it could be huge for your enterprise.

Moreover, now that you’ve got that phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text (SMS)
conversation right away… which is so powerful, because getting in
touch with someone within the first 5 minutes is 100 times more
productive than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new text messaging feature lets you stay connected consistently
with new offers, content links, even just check-in notes to build a
relationship.

All I’ve just described is incredibly straightforward to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.
