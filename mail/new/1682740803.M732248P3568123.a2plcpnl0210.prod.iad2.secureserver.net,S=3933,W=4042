You have been contacted by Stephen Gates, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello, it's Stephen from ERC Concepts in Miami. 

Did your business suffer from the pandemic lockdowns?

If you kept your employees, the US government set aside funds for
small businesses who suffered.

The Employee Retention Credits (ERC) program is a government stimulus
program designed to help those businesses that kept their employees
during the pandemic.

You are eligible for up to $26,000 per employee. This is free money
that can be used for anything and never has to be paid back.

Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, businesses can now qualify
for the ERC even if they have already received a PPP loan.

We've been trusted by American businesses for 14+ years and helped
over 20,000 businesses like yours recover more than $4.5 BILLION in
ERC funds. 

We've worked with some big names including McDonalds, NFL, NBA, NHL,
MLB, Visa, Rolex, Citibank, AMEX, Uber, and Burger King.

There's zero risk. No upfront fees. We get paid when you get paid. 

Qualifying is fast and simple.

Step 1:
We determine if you qualify via a quick phone call.

Step 2:
We analyze your claim and submit the paperwork on your behalf.

Step 3:
Receive up to $26,000 per employee that you don't have to pay back.

If your US-based business has 5 or more W-2 employees, then we can
help you get the funds you need even if you think that you don't
qualify. 

Filing deadlines are approaching so don't delay.
