You have been contacted by James Roser, and the message is as follows.

"It's not time to sit back and watch your competitors pump out content
for their websites and dominate your local market.

Not learning how to use A.I. is a great way to gaurantee that you will
not get your website on the first page of Google.

If you're not using A.I. to redo your website, ads, videos, blog
articles, social media posts, and more... Good luck. 

At least have someone in your office start learning how to use A.I.

Most companies are charging to use A.I. by the "word" and they call it
a "credit."

This particular A.I. tool charges monthly and gives you unlimited
"Words/credits" every month.
