You have been contacted by Jorge Head, and the message is as follows.

"Cool website!

Hi ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

My name’s Jorge, and I recently located your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - while navigating the net. You surfaced at the
top of the search results, so I checked you out. Seems like what
you’re doing is quite cool.  

But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me stumbles
across ststephenssanjose.org, what typically happens?

Is your site generating leads for your company? 

I’m guessing some, but I also wager you’d like more… studies
reveal that 7 out 10 who arrive on a site finish leaving without a
trace.

Not good.

Here’s a idea – what if there was an easy way for every visitor to
“lift their hand” to get a phone call from you INSTANTLY… the
minute they hit your site and stated, “call me now.”

You can –
  
Web Visitor is a software widget that’s functions on your site,
ready to catch any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. 
It lets you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can chat to that lead
while they’re literally looking your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitor now to see specifically how it works.

Time is money when it comes to linking with leads – the difference
in between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later
can be huge – like 100 times better!

That’s why we built our new SMS Text With Lead feature… because
once you’ve grabbed the visitor’s phone number, you can
automatically start a text message (SMS) conversation.
  
Consider the possibilities – even if you don’t close a deal then
and there, you can follow with text messages for new offers, content
links, even just “how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

Wouldn’t that be cool?

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to discover Web Visitor can do for
your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
Jorge

PS: Web Visitor provides FREE 14 days trial – and it even comprises
Long Distance Calling. 
You have customers waiting to to talk with you right now… don’t
keep them waiting.
