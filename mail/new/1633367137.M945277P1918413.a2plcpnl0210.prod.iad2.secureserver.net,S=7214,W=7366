You have been contacted by Eric Jones, and the message is as follows.

"Hey there, I just found your site, quick question…

My name’s Eric, I found ststephenssanjose.org after doing a quick
search – you showed up near the top of the rankings, so whatever
you’re doing for SEO, looks like it’s working well.

So here’s my question – what happens AFTER someone lands on your
site?  Anything?

Research tells us at least 70% of the people who find your site, after
a quick once-over, they disappear… forever.

That means that all the work and effort you put into getting them to
show up, goes down the tubes.

Why would you want all that good work – and the great site you’ve
built – go to waste?

Because the odds are they’ll just skip over calling or even grabbing
their phone, leaving you high and dry.

But here’s a thought… what if you could make it super-simple for
someone to raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without
requiring them to even pull their cell phone from their pocket?
  
You can – thanks to revolutionary new software that can literally
make that first call happen NOW.

Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that sits on your site,
ready and waiting to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and
Phone Number.  It lets you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can talk
to that lead while they’re still there at your site.
  
You know, strike when the iron’s hot!

CLICK HERE https://talkwithwebvisitors.com to try out a Live Demo with
Talk With Web Visitor now to see exactly how it works.

When targeting leads, you HAVE to act fast – the difference between
contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later is huge
– like 100 times better!

That’s why you should check out our new SMS Text With Lead feature
as well… once you’ve captured the phone number of the website
visitor, you can automatically kick off a text message (SMS)
conversation with them. 
 
Imagine how powerful this could be – even if they don’t take you
up on your offer immediately, you can stay in touch with them using
text messages to make new offers, provide links to great content, and
build your credibility.

Just this alone could be a game changer to make your website even more
effective.

Strike when  the iron’s hot!
