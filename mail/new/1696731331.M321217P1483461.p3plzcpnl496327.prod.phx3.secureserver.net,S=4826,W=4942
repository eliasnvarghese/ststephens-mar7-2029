"Dear to the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator! this is Eric and I
discovered ststephenssanjose.org a little while ago.

Seems great… but now what?

What I mean is, if someone like myself discovers your website –  via
Search or just bouncing around – what happens next? Do you getting a
lot of leads from your site, or at least enough to make you happy?

Frankly, most business websites fall a bit short in terms of it comes
to generating paying customers. Data show that 70% of a site’s
visitors leave and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…

Why not make it it really EASY for every visitor who arrives to get a
personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…

This is possible –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool widget that’s works on your site,
ready to grab every visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.
It alerts you the moment they make you know they’re interested –
so that you can talk to that lead while they’re really browsing your
site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to check out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it operates.

You’ll be amazed - the contrast between reaching out to someone
within just 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could boost
your results 100-fold.

It turns even better… after you’ve grabbed their phone number,
with our new SMS Text With Lead capability, you can instantly start a
text (SMS) discussion.

That way, even if you don’t finalize a deal right away, you can stay
connected with text messages for new deals, content links, even just
“how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

Quite sweet – AND effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to discover what Web Visitors Into
Leads can offer for your business.

You can be turning up to 100X more leads right now!

Eric
