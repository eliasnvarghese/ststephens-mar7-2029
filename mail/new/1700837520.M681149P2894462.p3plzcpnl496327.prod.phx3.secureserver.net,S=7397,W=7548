quick searching – you showed up near the peak of the search

after a swift once-over, they vanish… forever.

making them to appear, goes down the drain.

Why on earth would you wish all great work – and the fantastic site
you’ve created – go waste away?

Since the odds are they’ll just skip calling up or even grabbing
their mobile phone, leaving in the lurch.

But, here’s a thought… what you could make super-simple for
