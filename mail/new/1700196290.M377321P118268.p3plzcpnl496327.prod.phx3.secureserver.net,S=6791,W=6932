"To the ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster. My name’s Clara and I’ve
just ran across your site at ststephenssanjose.org...

I located it after a swift look, so your SEO is performing well…

Content seems good…

However, one thing’s lacking though…

A FAST, SIMPLE way to get in touch with you IMMEDIATELY.

Because research reveal that a visitor like me will only stay a short
time – 7 out of 10 vanish almost instantly, Click Browse Click…
then disappeared.

I’ve got the remedy:

set to catch any visitor Name, Email address, and Phone Number.

web browsing your site.

Moreover, now that you’ve got the phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature you can instantly start a text conversation
immediately… which is so powerful, because connecting in 5 minutes
is 100 times more efficient than waiting 30 minutes or more later.

The new texting function lets you follow up frequently with  content
links, even just follow-up notes to forge a connection.

All I’ve just outlined is very easy to put in place, cost-effective,
and beneficial.
