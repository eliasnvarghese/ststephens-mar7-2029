If you want more information on some of the other benefits of using
SMS to grow your business, then here are 12 solid reasons to implement
this simple strategy.

12 benefits of using SMS for business
So let’s dive into our 12 reasons you should start using SMS text
messaging for your business, then we’ll go on to tell you how you
can easily integrate this platform alongside your other existing
communication platforms to create an omnichannel approach to servicing
your customers.

1.Immediate delivery
As far as delivery goes, SMS is pretty quick, and it’s also
efficient – taking only seconds to reach a vast audience. It’s
rare to get such a quick and fast personalized message to an audience
with that kind of speed.

2. Immediate results
You will instantly be able to see those who have received it, along
with other analytical data such as those who have opened it, read it
and of course, the important one, which is those who have responded.

3. Personal
Because it’s directly sent to each individual client, SMS is a very
personal message. Mobile phones are very personal devices, so people
will often respond with more personal immediacy. You can improve this
still further by delivering it as a personal message to each
individual. This is sure to grab their attention.

Potential customers are far more likely to give you an email address
than they are their mobile phone number, so yes you need to keep an
email list too. But this demonstrates how personal most people take
their phone number to be. Once you have a phone number, it’s likely
that customers will be more responsive to your messaging because they
invited you in.

4. Cost-effective
Text messages are cheap especially if you buy them in bulk. No other
marketing method provides such affordable results, particularly if
compared with traditional marketing methods, such as TV, radio or
print media.     

5. Simple and easy
Due to its simplicity and reach, SMS has become a globally adopted
communication channel. Everyone knows how to open, read and text a
message. Moreover, thanks to the limitation in length (160
characters), messages are small, direct, concise and go straight to
the point. And who doesn’t like it sweet & simple?

6. Global marketing
Text messages are designed to reach anyone who has a reasonably modern
mobile device and a cell phone signal. So you can reach millions of
people in an instant, anytime, anywhere.

It’s estimated there are up to 7 billion mobile phones in daily use
today, so SMS is one of the few technologies that are universally
synced between all of the global mobile phone operators. You can reach
the world with text messaging.

7. Direct delivery
SMS is among the most direct ways of communicating with clients,
besides meeting face-to-face and a direct phone call. Since the other
2 can be complicated, time-consuming and expensive, it’s clear
who’s the winner!

8. Precise
Once you have your audience segmented, then you can accurately target
groups of customers with a variety of marketing messages.
Understanding what works and what doesn’t means you can refine your
approach to maximize sales potential.

9. Efficient
The ability to schedule text messages means that you can save time in
planning your campaign, you don’t need to write each message
individually, so groups of people can be targeted with scheduled
texts.

This then provides more time to spend on other areas of the business,
or indeed, managing the bulk of sales opportunities that will come
back from your SMS delivery very soon after sending.

10. Trackable and analytics
SMS can easily be trackable too, most providers offer delivery reports
which can be a great source for interrogating what successes you’ve
had with your SMS deliveries, so you can fully and accurately rate the
success of your campaigns. You can then take lessons learned into the
next campaign.

11. Reliable
Mobile phones don’t generally come with a spam filter, let alone a
spam box. Mostly as mobile phone SMS messages are generally safer than
email which can deliver all kinds of shady attachments. Plus, delivery
occurs within a 48 hour period to allow for phones being switched off
or out of range of a signal.

So, for the most part, you know delivery by SMS is a reliable form of
inboxing your customers. At worst, you might get your phone number
blocked. But then that can be down to your message and your audience.

12. SMS vs email
SMS text messages have a far higher “open rate” than email. Plus,
with email, you could be sending your emails to clients that long
assigned your name to the junk box. If your text messages aren’t
delivered, then there is feedback on that through the medium.

Emails, of course, have their place and are still extremely effective
in communicating with customers and increasing sales opportunities, as
people say, “the money is in the list!”. But SMS is actually
quicker, and safer overall.

Armed with those undeniable advantages, let’s assume you like the
idea and are probably wondering how you would go about setting up this
system. So let’s dive into that by setting an appointment with our
