You have been contacted by Ahmad Oh, and the message is as follows.

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Administrator!

This is Ahmad and I stumbled upon ststephenssanjose.org a short while
ago.  

Appears great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone like me discovers your website – either
through Search or just bouncing around – what happens next?  Do you
get numerous of leads from your site, or at least enough to make you
happy?

Frankly, most business websites fall a bit short when it comes to
generating paying customers. Studies reveal that 70% of a site’s
visitors leave and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…
 
How about making it really STRAIGHTFORWARD for every visitor who shows
up to get a personal phone call from they hit your site…
 
You can –
  
Lead Conversion is a software widget that’s functions on your site,
set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number. 
It notifies you the moment they tell you they’re interested – so
that you can chat to that lead while they’re literally looking over
your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see precisely how it works.

You’ll be amazed - the difference between contacting someone within
5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could boost your results
100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text
(SMS) conversation.
  
That way, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can
continue with text messages for new offers, content links, even just
“how you doing?” notes to develop a relationship.

Very sweet – AND effective.
