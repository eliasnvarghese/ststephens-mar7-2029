You have been contacted by Neal Gaddis, and the message is as follows.

"Hello,

My name is Neal and I hope this email finds you’re well. 


Are you interested in Your business in Googles Autocomplete?

For example, if you searches Personal Injury Attorney Boston, Google
will recommend ( Micheal O Smith.) This is our client!

Or If you search on Microsoft Bing for Sacramento Plumbers (Lees Air
Plumbing Heating) This is also our client!


This is not advertising, it’s a new solution exclusive to us, called
Search Box Optimization. 


We get Google and Bing to autocomplete your company name for relevant
searches. 

If you want Google and Bing to recommend you, get back to me asap.


BTW this is a Pay-Per-Result solution, so you don’t pay if Google or
Bing doesn’t recommend you.

Search terms are exclusive, so once you get them, they are yours for
life. 



You can see the magic of SBO in a video Here: https://reachkings.com



Regards,
Neal
