You have been contacted by Grant Lira, and the message is as follows.

"Hey,

This Feb I’ll get you on 3 podcasts/mo + 15 professionally edited
short-form videos for social media (from the podcasts) + 3 features in
online publications/mo - done for you.

We’ve helped 37 clients do just that to build their thought
leadership in their specific industry which has helped them:

- Generate more appointments
- Close at a higher % (Because they built authority before the meeting
even started)
- Charge higher amounts because people view their company as a premium
option 

Interested? We are raising our service by 30 % on Feb 29th, but if we
chat before then, you’ll be locked in at the current amount. We can
chat here:

Best,
Grant

PS - I will not see your response so if you have a question, book a
time to chat (:
