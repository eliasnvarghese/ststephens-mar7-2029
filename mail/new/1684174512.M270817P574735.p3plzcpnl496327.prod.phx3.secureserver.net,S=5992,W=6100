You have been contacted by Heriberto Rascoe, and the message is as
follows.

"We have hacked your website ststephenssanjose.org and extracted your
databases. This was due to the security holes you had in your your
site/server which have gained us remote control of everything that was
on the server. 

Our team is mostly interested in customer, administrative, and
employee information which we have extracted through your databases
once we got remote control over the server. It still needs to be
sorted out but it will be well-organized once finished. First, we will
be going through the emails/sms information and contacting the
recipient how you held in disregard about their information being
exposed to a hacking group when you could have stopped it. This would
be detrimental to your personal image with these relationships with
these people. Lastly, now that we have information not only will we be
monetizing off it with our methods but made public or sold to other
people that will do whatever they wish with the information also after
we are done.

Now you can put a stop to this by paying a $3000 fee (0.11 BTC) in
bitcoin. You can find our address by visiting
https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/39PHuTwgY5THshy9VJoUXWebDA5jCprPmP
where you can copy and paste the address or scan the QR code. We will
be notified of payment which we will then delete the information we
have obtained, patch the hole in the site/server which we got in and
remove you from any future targeting in the future. You have 72 hours
in doing so after viewing this message or the series of steps will
commence. You can obtain bitcoin through such services such as
paxful.com or do a search on bing.com"

You can contact Heriberto Rascoe via email, hacker@mahimahitravel.com
