"Dear to ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

Great website!

 name’s Celeste, and I recently found your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - when surfing the net. Your site popped up at
the very top of the search results, so I looked you out. Looks like
what you’re doing is really interesting.

But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me comes
across ststephenssanjose.org, what typically happens?

Is your site create leads for your business?

I’m guessing a few, but I also assume you’d prefer more…
research suggest that 7 out 10 who land on a site end up leaving
without any interaction.

That's unfortunate.

Here’s a suggestion – what if there's an effortless way for each
visitor to “raise their hand” to get a phone call from you
INSTANTLY… the second they land on your site and expressed, “call
me now.”

You can –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool widget that’s functions on your
site, set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It lets you be informed INSTANTLY – so that you can chat to
that lead as they’re actually looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to experience a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

Time is essential when it comes to connecting with leads – the
difference between reaching out to someone in just 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be huge – like 100 times more effective!

That’s why we created out our new SMS Text With Lead capability…
since after you’ve collected the visitor’s phone number, you can
instantly start a text message (SMS) chat.

Imagine about the opportunities – even if you don’t close a deal
immediately, you can keep in touch with text messages for new
promotions, content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to
create a relationship.

Wouldn’t that be fantastic?

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can offer for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads today!
Celeste

PS: Web Visitors Into Leads provides a FREE 14 days trial – and it
