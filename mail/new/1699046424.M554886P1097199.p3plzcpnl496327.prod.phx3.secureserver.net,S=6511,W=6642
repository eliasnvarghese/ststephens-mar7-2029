Number. It signals you the moment they make you know they’re

actually viewing your site.

Plus, when you’ve got their phone number, with our new SMS Text With
Lead function, you can automatically start a text (SMS) chat… and if
they don’t take you up on your offer at that time, you can follow-up
with text messages for fresh offers, content links, or even just
“how you doing?” notes to develop a relationship.
