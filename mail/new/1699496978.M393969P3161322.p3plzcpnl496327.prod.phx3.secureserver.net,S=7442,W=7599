"Hello to the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator,

This is Kassie and I recently came across your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - on the search results

Here is what that means to me… to me…

Your SEO’s operating.

You’re getting eyeballs – mine at least.

Your content’s not bad, wouldn’t change a thing.

BUT…

Eyeballs do not pay the bills

CUSTOMERS do.

And research show that 7 out of 10 visitors to a site like
ststephenssanjose.org will stop by, look around, and then depart
without doing anything anything else.

It’s like they never were even even there.

You can fix this.

You can make it it super-simple for them to raise to raise their hand
say, “okay, let’s talk” without needing them to even pull their
cell phone from their pocket thanks to Web Visitors Into Leads.

ready and waiting and waiting to snatch any visitor’s Name, Email

you’ve got their phone number, so now you can begin a text message
(SMS) conversation with them… so even if they don’t take you up
you up on your offer right away, you continue to text to text them new
offers, and new reasons to do business with you.

This could alter everything for you and your business
