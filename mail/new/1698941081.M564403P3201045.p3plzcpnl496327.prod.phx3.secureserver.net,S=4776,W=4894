"To the ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster!

This is Kasha and I discovered ststephenssanjose.org a short while
ago.  

Appears great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone like me finds your website – either
through Browsing or just bouncing around – what happens next?  Do
you get many of leads from your site, or at least enough to make you
satisfied?

Honestly, most business websites fall a bit short when it comes to
generating paying customers. Studies indicate that 70% of a site’s
visitors vanish and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…
 
How about making it really STRAIGHTFORWARD for every visitor who shows
up to get a personal phone call from they hit your site…
 
You can –
  
Web Conversion is a software widget that’s functions on your site,
ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.
 It alerts you the moment they inform you they’re interested – so
that you can talk to that lead while they’re actually looking over
your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to test a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

You’ll be astonished - the difference between contacting someone
within 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could boost your
results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text
(SMS) conversation.
  
That way, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can follow
up with text messages for new offers, content links, even just “how
you doing?” notes to establish a relationship.

Very sweet – AND effective.

for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
