You have been contacted by Brianne Jamieson, and the message is as
follows.

"Hi ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster!

My name is Brianne and, contrary to numerous emails you could get, I
wanted to rather provide you with a word of encouragement – Kudos!

What for?

A portion of my job is to review websites and the work you’ve done
with ststephenssanjose.org certainly is notable. 

It’s clear you took building a website to heart and made a genuine
investment of time and resources into making it superior.

Nevertheless, there is, however, a catch… more accurately, a
question…

So, when someone like me discovers your site – possibly at the top
of the search results (great job by the way) or just through a random
link, how do you know?

Moreover, how do you make a link with that person?

Studies indicate that 7 out of 10 visitors depart – they’re there
one second and then disappeared.

There’s a way to create INSTANT engagement that you may not have
known about…

Lead Capture is a software widget that’s operates on your site,
ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. It allows you know IMMEDIATELY that they’re interested –
so that you can speak to that lead while they’re really looking over
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

It might be a revolutionary change for your business – and it gets
even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new
SMS Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text (SMS)
conversation – immediately (and there’s really a 100X difference
between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Plus then, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you can
connect later on with text messages for new offers, content links,
even just follow-up notes to forge a relationship.

All I’ve just described is straightforward, convenient, and
productive.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to learn what Lead Capture can do
for your business.

You might be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Brianne
PS: Lead Capture offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes
International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers waiting to talk with you at this moment… don’t
keep them waiting.

Merely a quick message - the identities and email applied here,
Brianne and Jamieson, are placeholders and not really actual contact
details. We esteem honesty and wished to make sure you’re aware! If
you wish to communicate with the genuine one behind this message,
kindly check out our site, and we’ll unite you with the proper
person.
