You have been contacted by Anneliese Chauncy, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello there,

If you have been considering buying in Florida, we have every build
project in the state listed on 
our website. Builders are slashing prices and wheeling and dealing
trying to sell fast due to the 
rapidly changing market.

Builders have way more projects than buyers and are offering big
discounts right from the start.
Many can even help with more creative financing so they don't take a
loss.

If you think prices are too high, this website may surprise you.

Get huge price cuts, incentives and possibly even help with financing
for your brand spanking new home right here at

https://specialzap.com/FLNewConstruction

All the best,
