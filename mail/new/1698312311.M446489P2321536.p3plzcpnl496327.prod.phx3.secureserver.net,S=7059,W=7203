You have been contacted by Jody Churchill, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Manager.

It's Jody here with a short thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m across the internet a lot and I observe many business websites.

Like yours, several them have great content.

But frequently, they come up short when it comes to connecting and
linking with someone who visits.

I get it – it’s challenging. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who
land on a site, abandon it in moments without leaving even a trace.
You got the eyeball, but nothing else.

I have a solution for you…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s functions on
your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. You’ll know right away they’re interested and you
can call them directly to talk with them actually while they’re
still on the web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to test a Live Demo with Instant
Engagement Tool now to see precisely how it works.

It can be enormous for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – instantly… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more effective
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Additionally, with text messaging you can follow up later with new
offers, content links, even just follow-up notes to keep the
conversation going.

Everything I’ve just described is extremely easy to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to discover what Instant Engagement
Tool can do for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Jody
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers waiting to talk with you right now… don’t keep
them waiting.

Simply a quick message - the monikers and email address used in this
communication, Jody and Churchill, are stand-ins and not really real
contact details. We cherish openness and wished to ensure you’re
aware of this! If you want to make contact with the actual one behind
this note, do go to our website, and we’ll associate you with the
appropriate individual.
