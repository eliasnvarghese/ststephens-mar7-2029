You have been contacted by Rogelio Navarro, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Manager.

My name is Rogelio and, unlike many emails you may get, I wish to
instead provide you with a word of kudos – Kudos!

What for?

Part of my job is to check out websites and the work you’ve done
with ststephenssanjose.org definitely is remarkable. 

It’s clear you have taken building a website to heart and made a
real investment of effort into making it superior.

Nevertheless, there is, however, a catch-22… more precisely, a
question…

So, when someone like me happens to find your site – maybe at the
peak of the search results (great job by the way) or just through a
random link, how do you find out?

More importantly, how do you make a bond with that person?

Studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors leave – they’re there one
second and then gone with the wind.

Here’s a way to create PROMPT engagement that you may not have known
about…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s functions on
your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. It lets you know INSTANTLY that they’re interested –
so that you can speak to that lead while they’re literally looking
over ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to experience a Live Demo
with Lead Capture now to see specifically how it works.

It can be a game-changer for your business – and it gets even
better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can immediately start a text (SMS)
conversation – instantly (and there’s actually a 100X difference
between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Plus then, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can
connect later on with text messages for new offers, content links,
even just follow-up notes to build a relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is straightforward, user-friendly,
and efficient.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to discover what Web
Visitors Into Leads can do for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more leads today!

PS: Instant Engagement Tool offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers eager to talk with you immediately… don’t keep
them waiting.

this! If ever you wish to connect with the real one responsible for
this message, kindly go to our website, and we’ll connect you with
