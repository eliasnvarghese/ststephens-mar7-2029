"Arnold Schwarzenegger: Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life 
 
THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER 
 
The seven rules to follow to realize your true purpose in life -
distilled by Arnold Schwarzenegger from his own journey of ceaseless
reinvention and extraordinary achievement, and available for
absolutely anyone. 
 
The world’s greatest bodybuilder. The world’s highest-paid movie
star. The leader of the world’s sixth-largest economy. That these
are the same person sounds like the setup to a joke, but this is no
joke. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger. And this did not happen by
accident. 
  
Arnold’s stratospheric success happened as part of a process. As the
result of clear vision, big thinking, hard work, direct communication,
resilient problem-solving, open-minded curiosity, and a commitment to
giving back. All of it guided by the one lesson Arnold’s father
hammered into him above all: be useful. As Arnold conquered every
realm he entered, he kept his father’s adage close to his heart. 
  
Written with his uniquely earnest, blunt, powerful voice, Be
Useful takes readers on an inspirational tour through Arnold’s tool
kit for a meaningful life. He shows us how to put those tools to work,
in service of whatever fulfilling future we can dream up for
ourselves. He brings his insights to vivid life with compelling
personal stories, life-changing successes and life-threatening
failures alike—some of them famous; some told here for the first
time ever. 
  
Too many of us struggle to disconnect from our self-pity and connect
to our purpose. At an early age, Arnold forged the mental tools to
build the ladder out of the poverty and narrow-mindedness of his rural
Austrian hometown, tools he used to add rung after rung from there.
Now he shares that wisdom with all of us. As he puts it, no one is
going to come rescue you—you only have yourself. The good news, it
turns out, is that you are all you need.
