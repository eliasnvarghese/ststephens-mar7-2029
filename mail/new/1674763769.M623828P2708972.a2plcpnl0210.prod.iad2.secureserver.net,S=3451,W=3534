You have been contacted by Nick James, and the message is as follows.

"Hello,

My name is Nick James and I help organizations like yours take
advantage of the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) program, a federal
grant from the IRS that allows businesses to recover taxes and wages.

I know that many companies are unaware of this program or assume they
do not qualify. However, recent changes in the eligibility
requirements mean that your organization may now be eligible to claim
up to $26,000 per employee. Since the start of the ERC program, our
company has filed over 19,000 claims for organizations just like
yours, totaling over $3.2 billion in grants.

If you would allow me 10 minutes for a quick call, I can let you know
if this program would be a fit for your business. There is no up-front
cost and we only get paid for our services if we secure a grant for
you. 

Please book a call on my calendar at the bottom of my website
https://bottomlinesavingstax.com or send me a text at 305-419-1382.

If you are not the appropriate person to speak with, I would be
grateful if you could point me in the right direction or forward my
information to the appropriate person.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,

Nick James
