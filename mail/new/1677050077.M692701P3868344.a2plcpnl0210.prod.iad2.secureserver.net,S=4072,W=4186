"Hi,

imagine having the power of a Google PPC campaign with an unlimited
budget, but without the hassle, budget limitations, or competition
that typically comes with it. That is how POWERFUL Search Box
Optimization can be.

You can steal potential customers away from your competitors before
they even reach page one of the search results for Google and Bing. We
call this Search Box Optimization. Imagine your customers not even
knowing your competition exists because they click on your business
name right from the search box.

When you are in auto-complete, your company is seen before any of your
competitors.  The keyword phrase is a BILLBOARD to potential
customers.
You’re not fighting over search results, you're getting the traffic
before the users even hit the search result page.
 It looks like Google and Bing are recommending your business – huge
branding value
Google says 71% of all search engine users select an auto-complete /
auto-suggested keyword.

 When a customer selects your auto-completed (auto-suggested) keyword
term with your company linked, it takes it to a search page that
highlights your business's online presence. It’s like a billboard
taking over the entire page.

calling 702-213-5665. We'll be happy to discuss how we can help you
outperform your competitors.

Best regards,
Rosey
