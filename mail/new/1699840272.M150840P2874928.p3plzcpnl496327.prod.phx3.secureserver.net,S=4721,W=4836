You have been contacted by Donte Dawson, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

This is Donte and please, imagine this…

- An individual does a search and winds up at ststephenssanjose.org.

- They linger for a minute to check it out.  I’m interested…
but… maybe…

- And then they hit the back button and explore the other search
results alternatively. 

- Ultimately – you got an eyeball, but nada to show for it.

- Off they go.

This isn’t really your fault – it happens a lot – studies show 7
out of 10 visitors to any site vanish without leaving a trace.

But you CAN fix that.
