"To the ststephenssanjose.org Owner!

Nice website!

My name’s Trent, and I  found your site - ststephenssanjose.org -
when surfing the net. Your site popped up at the top of the search
engine results, so I looked you out. Looks like what you’re doing is
amazing.

But just in case you don’t mind me asking – once someone like me
lands across ststephenssanjose.org, what usually happens?

Is your site generating leads for your business?

I’m assuming a few, but I also guess you’d like more… data
suggest that 7 out 10 people that land on a site end up leaving
without leaving any trace.

Not good.

Here is a thought – what if there's an simple way for each visitor
to “signal interest” to get a phone call from you RIGHT AWAY…
the second they land on your site and said, “call me now.”

Well, you can –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool widget that’s operates on your
site, prepared to collect every visitor’s Name, Email address and
Phone Number. It allows you know RIGHT AWAY – so that you can talk
to that lead while they’re actually browsing your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it functions.

Time is crucial when it comes to reaching out to leads – the
difference between reaching out to someone in just 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be massive – like 100 times more effective!

That’s why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead function… since
after you’ve collected the visitor’s phone number, you can
instantly start a text message (SMS) chat.

Imagine about the possibilities – even if you don’t seal a deal
immediately, you can follow up with text messages for new deals,
content links, or even just “how you doing?” notes to establish a
relationship.

Would not that be fantastic?

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can do for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads today!
Trent

PS: Web Visitors Into Leads provides a FREE 14 days trial – and it
also comes with International Long Distance Calls. 
You have customers eager to chat with you right now… don’t keep
them waiting.
