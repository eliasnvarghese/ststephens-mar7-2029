"Hey,

If you want to turn Amazon into your own personal ATM...

This email will make your day…

Here’s the kicker:

There’s a way you can exploit Amazon’s Reviews System to drive
massive profits hands-free.

Venkata and his team were successful in developing and releasing an
intriguing (and I have to say, UNIQUE) app that is able to "hack" this
Reviews System...

And literally force Amazon to send 20,000 Buyer Clicks in mere
minutes…

It is a completely LEGAL method that complies with Amazon's TOS and
will not land you in trouble.
