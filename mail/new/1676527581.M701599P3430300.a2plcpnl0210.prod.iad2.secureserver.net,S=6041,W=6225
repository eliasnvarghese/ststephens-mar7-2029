You have been contacted by John Steffers, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello, 

I hope you’re having a great day. If not, you’re about to lol.

If you’re reading this, your website is not secure.

I just submitted your contact form on your website very easily using
robots pretending to be a lead.

You got notified, and you’re probably a little angry about it.

Whoever built your website did not build it with security in mind or
simply had no idea that this would happen.

This style of spamminess started happening on EVERY website I built
for my clients.

The industry didn’t matter.  It just kept happening.

My clients kept getting excited because they thought they were getting
notified about a potential lead coming from their website.

Then they instantly got angry and thought I was charging them for fake
leads. (We offer marketing services, and they pay per lead or per
click)

These bots were messing up my client’s ROI predictions and creating
fake data inside their systems.

I want nothing more than to have happy clients who write raving
testimonials.  

If I wanted my clients to stick around, I needed to figure out why we
were getting spammers several times per day. 

So I did just that.

I spent the last 5 months trying to solve this headache. 

This is what I found out:

1.) You can “opt-out” of receiving these messages/emails ,but
nothing ever changes.

2.) Nothing changes because people are creating MASSIVE lists of
websites and selling the data.  You can pay for lists on Fiverr and
other shady places on the internet.

(How do I know? Your website contact page is on a list of over 4
million website domain names.  I simply bought the list and started
messaging you.  It’s that simple! And annoying lol)

3.) It’s impossible to tell how many people have your website on
their list.

4.) I figured out that I could control / manage the spammers for my
clients by creating segmentations. 

5.) I was able to reduce the spam into my client’s inboxes by 99%.

6.) I figured out a way to prevent the contact form from being
submitted on the contact page based on specific triggers.

Anyway, I don’t want to take up too much more of your time. 

If you’re fed up with receiving these messages, you have two
options:

1.) Click the link in the bottom of this particular email and opt-out
from any further communication from ME. However, as I was saying
above, unfortunately, your website is not just on my list.  It’s on
a list that I purchased.  You’d have to opt-out of everyone’s
list. Which is impossible because most people will not allow you to. 
They don't even give you the option.

2.) You could remove your website’s contact form, but then you’ll
struggle to receive legitimate leads.

3.) I can set up spammer-protection and do the same thing for you that
I do for my clients. We build secure websites and provide peace of
mind.  All while eliminating fake leads.  

Is it 100 percent accurate? No, it’s a constant battle, but we
eliminate 99 percent of the garbage. 

I can’t do this for everyone, even though I wish I could.  If
you’re using Wordpress, we can help you.  If you’re not using
Wordpress, we may have to rebuild your website.  Which we'd love to do
anyway.

I know, that doesn’t sound fun.

Again, I apologize for reaching out to you like this.  

As this new way of contacting businesses is becoming increasingly
popular, spam will only get worse.

There are people on Youtube training other people how to use robots to
spam business contact forms to sell products. 

If you’re fed up, watch this short video I made for you.

We’ll eliminate garbage and make tomorrow spam free.

I look forward to hearing from you.
