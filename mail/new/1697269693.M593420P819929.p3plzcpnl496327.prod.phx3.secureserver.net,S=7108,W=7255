"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Admin.

This is Christina here with a short thought about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m throughout the internet quite a bit and I observe a lot of
business websites.

Just like yours, a number of them have fantastic content.

But all too often, they come up short when it comes to interacting and
linking with someone who visits.

I realize – it’s hard. Studies show 7 out of 10 people who visit a
site, abandon it in moments without leaving a trace. You got the
eyeball, but nothing else.

There’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You’ll know instantly they’re interested and you can call
them directly to chat with them literally while they’re still on the
web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experience a Live Demo with Lead
Capture now to see specifically how it works.

It can be enormous for your business – and because you’ve got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can
instantly start a text (SMS) conversation – right away… and
contacting someone in that 5-minute window is 100 times more effective
than reaching out 30 minutes or more later.

Moreover, with text messaging you can follow up later with new offers,
content links, even just follow-up notes to continue the conversation
going.

Each aspect I’ve just described is extremely easy to implement,
cost-effective, and profitable.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can do for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads today!

Christina
PS: Lead Capture offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes
International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers eager to talk with you right now… don’t keep
them waiting.

Just a rapid notification - the monikers and email applied here,
Christina and Gormanston, are placeholders and not really real
information. We esteem candor and wanted to ensure you’re aware of
this! If ever you want to communicate with the real person behind this
memo, please visit our site, and we’ll connect you with the correct
individual.
