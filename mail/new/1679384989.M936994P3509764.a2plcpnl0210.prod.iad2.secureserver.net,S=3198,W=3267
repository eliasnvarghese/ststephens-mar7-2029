You have been contacted by Ira Turner, and the message is as follows.

"My name is Ira Turner, and I'm an ERC consultant. I'm not selling
anything at all, you have my word. I just wanted to talk to you about
getting your employee retention refund...up to $26K per employee. It
won't cost you a dime.
 
Perhaps you've seen all of the commercials and ads about the IRS
giving away massive, nonrepayable refunds, to small businesses with 5
or more employees, impacted by COVID during 2020 & 2021.
 
If you're skeptical - don't be - its absolutely true. However, this
has brought scammers out in droves.
There are only a few legitimate companies helping small businesses get
these massive refunds which they never have to repay.
http://www.RefundsNow.org is one of them. You'll find all of the
details there. It'll take less than 2 minutes to submit your
application. Again, that's http://www.RefundsNow.org

If you have any questions or would like for me to help you submit your
application, just call or text me at 888-400-8898. Thanks."

You can contact Ira Turner via email, iraturner@theercgroup.org
