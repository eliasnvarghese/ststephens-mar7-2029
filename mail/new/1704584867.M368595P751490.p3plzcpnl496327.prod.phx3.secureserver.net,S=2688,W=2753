"Hi there,

We run an Instagram growth service, which increases your number of
followers safely and practically. 

We aim to gain you 300-1000+ real human followers per month, with all
actions safe as they are made manually (no bots).

The price is just $60 (USD) per month, and we can start immediately.

Let me know if you wish to see some of our previous work.

Kind Regards,
Megan"
