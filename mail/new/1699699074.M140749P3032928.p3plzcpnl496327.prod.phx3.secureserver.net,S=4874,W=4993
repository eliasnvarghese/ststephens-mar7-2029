You have been contacted by Don Allison, and the message is as follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Admin.

This is Don and I discovered ststephenssanjose.org a short while ago. 


Seems great… but now what?

By that I mean, when someone such as me locates your website –
either through Browsing or just bouncing around – what happens next?
 Do you get numerous of leads from your site, or at least enough to
make you happy?

Frankly, most business websites fall short when it comes to generating
paying customers. Studies indicate that 70% of a site’s visitors
vanish and are gone forever after just a moment.

Here’s an idea…
 
How about making it really EASY for every visitor who arrives to get a
personal phone call from you as soon as they hit your site…
 
You can –
  
Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s functions on
your site, set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and
Phone Number.  It signals you the moment they tell you they’re
interested – so that you can chat to that lead while they’re
actually looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo with
Lead Conversion now to see exactly how it works.

You’ll be astonished - the difference between contacting someone
within 5 minutes versus a half-hour or more later could enhance your
results 100-fold.

It gets even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with
our new SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text
(SMS) conversation.
  
That way, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you can
continue with text messages for new offers, content links, even just
how you doing? notes to establish a relationship.

Pretty sweet – AND effective.
