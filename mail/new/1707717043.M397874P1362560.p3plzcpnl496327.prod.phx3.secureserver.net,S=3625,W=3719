"Hey,

Are you aware that a donation from ststephenssanjose.org could save a
life ?

At https://MoneyForWater.com We firmly believe that investing in water
is crucial for improving health, supporting women's empowerment,
facilitating access to education, boosting family incomes, and
positively impacting lives. However, it's disheartening to note that 1
BILLION people still don't have access to safe water.

But don't worry! We're on a mission to change that. We're dedicated to
bringing water and sanitation solutions to communities all around the
globe.

Together, we can make a difference!

Would you be willing to make a contribution to my fundraiser? A gift
of any amount would mean the world to me.

To donate, simply click the link to my fundraiser below:

https://MoneyForWater.com

We will provide you instantly with a tax receipt.

It would also mean a lot if you could share my fundraiser link on
social media.
The more exposure I get, the faster I will reach my fundraising goal.


Also, some donors asked to be able to send donations in Bitcoin so we
listened .
You can now Send any amount of BTC to the following address :

bc1qn6ch9x0utul2nrh4t4g3tj20685c5dq8m0vy5fu349vat5lw4wvqghxp7z

I appreciate all of your support! https://MoneyForWater.com wouldnâ€™t
be able to accomplish our goal without your help.

Steve
