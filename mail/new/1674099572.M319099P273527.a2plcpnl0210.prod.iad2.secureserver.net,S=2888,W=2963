You have been contacted by Betsey Goode, and the message is as
follows.

"Hey,

Have you heard about this AI that can write your marketing copy for
you? I signed up for Jasper but I was skeptical if the quality would
be any good…

(I mean come’on, a robot that writes copy? No way.)

But after using it for the last 3 months, I can honestly say it’s a
game-changer.

It’s like I hired an assistant who writes way better and faster than
I do!

I recently published a video on my YouTube channel showing my exact
workflow using Jasper to create SEO-optimized blog posts in 1/5th the
time.

Watch it here and let me know what you think in the comments.

Welcome to the future,
"
