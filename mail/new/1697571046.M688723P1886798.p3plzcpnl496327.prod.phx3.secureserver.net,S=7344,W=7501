"Greetings ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

I am Roscoe and I just recently discovered your webpage -
ststephenssanjose.org - in the search results.

This is what that implies to me…

Your SEO’s working.

You’re getting eyeballs – mine at least.

Your content’s not bad, wouldn’t change a single thing.

BUT…

Eyeballs do not pay the invoices.

CUSTOMERS do.

And surveys show that 7 out of 10 visitors to ststephenssanjose.org
will stop by, have a look, and then head for the hills without doing
else.

It’s like they never even were even there.

You can fix this.

“okay, let’s talk” without requiring them to even pull their
phone from their pocket… thanks to Visitor to Lead Widget.
