You have been contacted by Jorelle Castillo, and the message is as
follows.

"Hi, just wanted to check if you've received your Employee Retention
Credit (ERC) yet.

If you haven't heard about it, it's a government program similar to
the PPP, but the best part is, it's not a loan! You don't have to pay
it back. You can receive up to $26k per employee (average is around
$10k) for those you had in 2020 and 2021.

We'll handle all the work for you free of charge and without any
upfront cost. You only pay when you see the money deposited in your
bank. So, there's no risk involved.

Weâ€™ve helped over 40,000 businesses receive their ERC. We'd like to
volunteer and give your business a free analysis to see exactly how
much you could get.

If you're interested, just shoot me a text at (305) 520-7625

Regards,
Jorelle
