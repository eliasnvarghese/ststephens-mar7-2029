"Hi to ststephenssanjose.org Owner. I've just found your site, quick
question…

My name’s Latesha, I found ststephenssanjose.org post performing a
swift search – your site showed up near the top of the search
rankings, so whatever you’re doing for SEO, seems like it’s
working well.

So here is my query – what exactly transpires AFTER an individual
lands on your site? Anything?

Studies tells us at least 70% of the people who locate your website,
after a rapid glance, they leave… permanently.

That indicates that all the hard work and effort you put into getting
them to arrive, goes down the drain.

Why on earth would you want all of that great work – and the
excellent site you’ve built – go to waste away?

As the probabilities are they’ll just skip over calling or even
grabbing their phone, leaving high and dry.

But, here’s a thought… what if you could make it very simple for
someone raise their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without
needing them to even pull their mobile phone from their pocket to
groundbreaking new software can literally make that first call happen
