Phone Number. It signals you the instant they make you know they’re
interested – meaning that you can chat to that lead whilst they’re
actually looking over your site.

With Lead function, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
discussion… and if they don’t agree on your offer then, you can
follow up with text messages for fresh offers, content links, even
just “how you doing?” notes to forge a relationship.
