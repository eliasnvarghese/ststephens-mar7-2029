"Howdy!

I'm really impressed with what you folks are doing at
ststephenssanjose.org and eager if you would allow me penning an
article about your efforts and sharing it on my website?

My intention is to do this completely free - no hidden agendas, I
simply need your permission first!

This is the place I'll be posting it, and we often get a ton of
excellent traffic! Check it out here:

This is my little way to 'pay it forward' :) Looking forward to hear
back!

Best wishes,
Larue
