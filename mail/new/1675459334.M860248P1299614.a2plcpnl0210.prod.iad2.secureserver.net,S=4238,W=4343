You have been contacted by Eric Jones, and the message is as follows.

"Hey, my name’s Eric and for just a second, imagine this…

- Someone does a search and winds up at ststephenssanjose.org.

- They hang out for a minute to check it out.  “I’m interested…
but… maybe…”

- And then they hit the back button and check out the other search
results instead. 

- Bottom line – you got an eyeball, but nothing else to show for
it.

- There they go.

This isn’t really your fault – it happens a LOT – studies show 7
out of 10 visitors to any site disappear without leaving a trace.

But you CAN fix that.

Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It lets you know right then and there – enabling you to
call that lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to try out a Live Demo with Talk
With Web Visitor now to see exactly how it works.

Time is money when it comes to connecting with leads – the
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be huge – like 100 times better!

Plus, now that you have their phone number, with our new SMS Text With
Lead feature you can automatically start a text (SMS) conversation…
so even if you don’t close a deal then, you can follow up with text
messages for new offers, content links, even just “how you doing?”
notes to build a relationship.

Strong stuff.

Visitor can do for your business.
