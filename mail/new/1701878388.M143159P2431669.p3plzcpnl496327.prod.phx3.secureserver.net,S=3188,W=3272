You have been contacted by Grant Lira, and the message is as follows.

"Hey,

You’ll receive a 120k Google Ads credit or you don’t pay me. (I
know it sounds unbelievable, so I’ll show you)
How? 

By using Google’s Grant Program which allows businesses to attain
complementary 10k/mo (120k/yr) Google Ads credits when they correctly
apply (which is what we specialize in).

The single stipulation is that you must be doing at least 7 figures in
your business to be eligible and we are guaranteeing the 10k/mo credit
approval for our next 5 partners because it’s quite labor intensive
for us. 

Would you be interested in learning more over a short talk? You can

Best,
Grant

PS - I won’t see your response on here so if you have a question,
