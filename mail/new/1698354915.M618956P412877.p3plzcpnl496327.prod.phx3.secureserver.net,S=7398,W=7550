You have been contacted by Opal Gates, and the message is as follows.

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

My name is Opal and, contrary to numerous emails you may get, I wish
to rather provide you with a word of congratulations –
Congratulations!

What for?

Part of my job is to check out websites and the work you’ve done
with ststephenssanjose.org definitely is notable. 

It’s clear you took building a website seriously and made a true
investment of time and resources into making it top quality.

However, there is, however, a catch-22… more accurately, a
question…

So, when someone like me stumbles upon your site – perhaps at the
top of the search results (great job BTW) or just through a random
link, how do you know?

Furthermore, how do you make a connection with that person?

Studies reveal that 7 out of 10 visitors don’t stick around –
they’re there one second and then vanished.

Here’s a way to create INSTANT engagement that you may not have
known about…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. It allows you know PROMPTLY that they’re interested – so
that you can talk to that lead while they’re really checking out
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to test a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see exactly how it works.

It can be a significant improvement for your business – and it gets
even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new
SMS Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation – instantly (and there’s really a 100X difference
between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Moreover then, even if you don’t close a deal instantly, you can
reconnect later on with text messages for new offers, content links,
even just follow-up notes to build a relationship.

Each aspect I’ve just described is easy, convenient, and efficient.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to find out what Lead Capture can do
for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Opal
PS: Lead Capture offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even includes
International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers waiting to talk with you immediately… don’t
keep them waiting.

Simply a rapid notification - the identities and email used here, Opal
and Gates, are substitutes and not real contact information. We esteem
honesty and wished to make sure you are conscious! If ever you want to
get in touch with the genuine one responsible for this note, kindly go
to our site, and we’ll unite you with the appropriate individual.
