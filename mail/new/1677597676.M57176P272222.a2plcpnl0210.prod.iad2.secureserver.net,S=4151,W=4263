"Hi owner of ststephenssanjose.org


We are currently recruiting new beginner paid online writers from your
country.

A number of Amazon stores on our platform are hiring assistants to
help with simple writing tasks. These positions are open to anyone
with moderate English skills, but we are particularly short of
candidates from your country.

These are remote positions, meaning that as long as you can work the
required hours, you can work from home. The businesses that hire our
members are all looking for new remote workers who donâ€™t need
experience but are willing to learn.

Click here to complete your application if you are interested:
https://www.gobanklogin.com/writingjobs .  

What you will be doing: Your job will be to write simple descriptions
for various products being added to Amazon stores. This is as simple
as writing a few bullet points based on the information given by the
client. You will be supplied with all the information needed, plus
clear instructions on what to do.

Contract length: No fixed term

Rate: $30 per hour (Depending on the type of job and experience)
