You have been contacted by Theresa Smith, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello,

I work with a company that makes ultra-thin stylish body weight bands
that you can wear all day with any outfit, even a dress or suit and
burn 750-1500 calories a day just by going about your day.

This is not a gimmick, our bands go on the wrist, ankle, waist and
come in sets of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 lbs. You are basically
carrying that around all day and your body is working (burning more
calories) to carry that extra load.

Benefits You’ll Get Instantly From Our All Day Body Weights:
 
- You’ll burn up to 1,500 calories a day as your body gets more
toned.
- You’ll start losing weight the natural way without having to
workout.
- You’ll start building more muscles and strength as you just go
about your day.

Imagine getting the body you always wanted, without having to workout
at a gym or having to go on a stressful diet. Well now you can, with
Elebands. 

Many of our clients are losing 2-3 pounds a week and getting
tremendous health benefits.
