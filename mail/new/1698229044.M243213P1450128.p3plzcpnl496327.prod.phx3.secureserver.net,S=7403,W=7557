"To the ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster!

Nice website!

My name’s Janessa, and I just came across your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - when browsing the net. You popped up on the
top of the search results, so I checked you out. Seems like what
you’re doing is quite impressive.

But if you don’t mind me asking – once someone like me stumbles
across ststephenssanjose.org, what usually happens?

Does your site generating leads for your business?

I’m thinking a few, but I also bet you’d like more… studies
suggest that 7 out 10 people that land on a site wind up leaving
without any interaction.

That's not ideal.

Here’s a suggestion – what if there's an effortless way for every
visitor to “raise their hand” to get a phone call from you RIGHT
AWAY… the moment they hit your site and said, “call me now.”

You can –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool widget that’s functions on your
site, ready to collect every visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It allows you know RIGHT AWAY – so that you can speak to
that lead as they’re actually looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to understand exactly how it works.

Timing is crucial when it comes to connecting with leads – the gap
between connecting with someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes
later can be significant – like 100 times more effective!

And that's why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead capability…
because once you’ve collected the visitor’s phone number, you can
instantly start a text message (SMS) chat.

Think about the opportunities – even if you don’t close a deal
right away, you can stay connected with text messages for fresh deals,
content links, or even just “how you doing?” notes to establish a
relationship.

Wouldn’t that be cool?

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to discover what Web Visitors Into
Leads can offer for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
Janessa

PS: Web Visitors Into Leads provides a FREE 14 days trial – and it
also includes International Long Distance Calls. 
You have customers eager to speak with you at this moment… don’t
leave them waiting.

Leads today.
