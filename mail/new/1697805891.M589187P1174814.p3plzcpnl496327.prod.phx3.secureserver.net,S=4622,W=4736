You have been contacted by Leila Molino, and the message is as
follows.

"Hello ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster!

My name’s Leila and just for a moment, imagine this…

- A user does a search and ends up at ststephenssanjose.org.

- They linger for a moment to explore.  “I’m interested… but…
maybe…”

- And then they click the back button and view the other search
results alternatively. 

- In essence – you got an eyeball, but nothing else to show for it.

- And they’re gone.

It isn’t really your fault – it happens a LOT – studies show 7
out of 10 visitors to any site vanish without leaving a trace.

But you can fix that.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. It lets you know immediately – enabling you to call
that lead while they’re actually looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to try out a Live Demo with Visitor
Engagement Widget now to see precisely how it works.

Time is of the essence when it comes to connecting with leads – the
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be enormous – like 100 times better!

Additionally, now that you have their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature you can instantly start a text (SMS)
conversation… so even if you don’t close a deal at that time, you
can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, even
just “how you doing?” notes to build a relationship.

Effective stuff.

Tool can do for your business.

You might be converting up to 100X more leads today!

Leila
PS: Lead Conversion Tool offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even

them waiting.
