You have been contacted by Rosaura Muecke, and the message is as
follows.

"Hi to ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster.

Awesome website!

 name’s Rosaura, and I recently came across your site -
ststephenssanjose.org - when surfing the net. Your site popped up at
the very top of the search engine results, so I looked you out. Seems
like what you’re doing is pretty cool.

But just in case you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me
stumbles across ststephenssanjose.org, what usually happens?

Does your site produce leads for your business?

I’m thinking some, but I also bet you’d love more… studies show
that 7 out 10 people that land on a site wind up leaving without a
trace.

That's not ideal.

Here’s a thought – what if there was an simple way for every
visitor to raise their hand to get a phone call from you INSTANTLY…
the second they hit your site and said, “call me now.”

Well, you can –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a application widget that’s functions on
your site, prepared to capture every visitor’s Name, Email address
and Phone Number. It lets you be informed RIGHT AWAY – so that you
can talk to that lead as they’re actually browsing your site.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to check out a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads today to see exactly how it functions.

Timing is essential when it comes to engaging with leads – the
distinction between reaching out to someone within 5 minutes compared
to 30 minutes later can be huge – like 100 times superior!

That’s why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead capability…
since once you’ve captured the visitor’s phone number, you can
automatically start a text message (SMS) discussion.

Imagine about the potential – even if you don’t close a deal right
away, you can keep in touch with text messages for new promotions,
content links, or even just “how you doing?” notes to create a
relationship.

Wouldn’t that be awesome?

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to find out what Web
Visitors Into Leads can offer for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads right now!

them waiting.
