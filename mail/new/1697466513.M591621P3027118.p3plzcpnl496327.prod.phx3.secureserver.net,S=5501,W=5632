You have been contacted by Marti Trumble, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Admin!

My name’s Marti, I came across ststephenssanjose.org after
performing a brief search – you showed up near the peak of the
rankings, so anything you’re doing for SEO, seems like it’s
operating well.  

So here’s my query – what happens AFTER someone reaches on your
site?  Anything?

Research inform us at least 70% of the persons who discover your site,
after a quick once-over, they vanish… forever.

That means that all the work and endeavor you put into making them to
show up, goes down the tubes.

Why would you want all that good work – and the fantastic site
you’ve created – go to waste?

Because the odds are they’ll just skip over over calling or even
grabbing their phone, leaving high and dry.

But here’s a thought… what if you could formulate it super-simple
for someone to lift their hand, say, “okay, let’s talk” without
demanding them to even draw their cell phone from their pocket?
  
You can – thanks to groundbreaking new software that can literally
make that first call occur NOW.

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that exists on your site,
set and waiting grab any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It lets you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can talk to that
lead while they’re still there at your site.
  
You understand, strike when the iron’s hot!

connecting with someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes later is
massive – like 100 times better!

as well… once you’ve grabbed the phone number of the site visitor,
you can immediately kick off a text message (SMS) conversation with
them. 

Imagine how strong this could be – even if they don’t take you up
on your offer instantly, you can stay in touch with them using text
messages to formulate new offers, offer links to excellent content,
and establish your credibility.

Just this by itself could be a game changer to make your website even
more productive.

Strike when the iron’s hot!
