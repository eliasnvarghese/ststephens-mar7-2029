"Hi there, my name is Cody Griner. I apologize for using your contact
form, 
but I wasn't sure who the right person was to speak with in your
company. 
We have a patented application that creates Local Area pages that rank
on 
top of Google within weeks, we call it Local Magic.  Here is a link to
the 
product page https://www.mrmarketingres.com/local-magic/ . The product

leverages technology where these pages are managed dynamically by AI
and 
it is ideal for promoting contractors on Google.  Can I share a
testimonial 
from one of our clients with you?  I can also do a short zoom to 
illustrate their full case study if you have time for it? 
cody@mrmarketingres.com 843-720-7301"
