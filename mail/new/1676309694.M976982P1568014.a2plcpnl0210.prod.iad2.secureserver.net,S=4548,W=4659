You have been contacted by Eric Jones, and the message is as follows.

"Cool website!

My name’s Eric, and I just found your site - ststephenssanjose.org -
while surfing the net. You showed up at the top of the search results,
so I checked you out. Looks like what you’re doing is pretty cool.
 
But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me stumbles
across ststephenssanjose.org, what usually happens?

Is your site generating leads for your business? 
 
I’m guessing some, but I also bet you’d like more… studies show
that 7 out 10 who land on a site wind up leaving without a trace.

Not good.

Here’s a thought – what if there was an easy way for every visitor
to “raise their hand” to get a phone call from you INSTANTLY…
the second they hit your site and said, “call me now.”

You can –
  
Talk With Web Visitor is a software widget that’s works on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number.  It lets you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can talk to that
lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to try out a Live Demo with Talk
With Web Visitor now to see exactly how it works.

Time is money when it comes to connecting with leads – the
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be huge – like 100 times better!

That’s why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead feature…
because once you’ve captured the visitor’s phone number, you can
automatically start a text message (SMS) conversation.
  
Think about the possibilities – even if you don’t close a deal
then and there, you can follow up with text messages for new offers,
content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to build a
relationship.

Wouldn’t that be cool?

Visitor can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
Eric
