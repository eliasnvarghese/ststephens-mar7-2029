You have been contacted by Brady Madison, and the message is as
follows.

"Hi ststephenssanjose.org Admin.

This is Brady and just for a moment, imagine this…

- An individual does a search and lands at ststephenssanjose.org.

- They linger for a minute to check it out.  I’m intrigued… but…
maybe…

- And then they press the back button and explore the other search
results alternatively. 

- Bottom line – you got an eyeball, but nada to show for it.

- And they’re gone.

It’s not really your fault – it happens a lot – studies show 7
out of 10 visitors to any site vanish without leaving a trace.

But you CAN fix that.

Lead Conversion Tool is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. It lets you know immediately – allowing you to call
that lead while they’re literally looking over your site.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to test a Live Demo with
Visitor Engagement Widget now to see exactly how it works.

Time is of the essence when it comes to connecting with leads – the
difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be massive – like 100 times better!

Additionally, now that you have their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature you can instantly start a text (SMS)
conversation… so even if you don’t close a deal then, you can
follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, even just
how you doing? notes to forge a relationship.

Powerful stuff.

Engagement Widget can do for your business.
