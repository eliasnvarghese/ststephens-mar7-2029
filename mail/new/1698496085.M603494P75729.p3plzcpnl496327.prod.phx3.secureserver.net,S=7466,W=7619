You have been contacted by Brendan Athaldo, and the message is as
follows.

"To the ststephenssanjose.org Admin.

My name is Brendan and, unlike many emails you might get, I wanted to
instead provide you with a word of commendation – Well done!

What for?

Part of my job is to check out websites and the work you have done
with ststephenssanjose.org absolutely is notable.

It is clear you took building a website to heart and invested a real
commitment of time and resources into creating it high quality.

Nonetheless, there is, a catch… to be more precise, a question…

So, when someone like me happens to find your site – perhaps at the
top of the search results (nice job BTW) or just through a random
link, how can you tell?

Even more importantly, how do you make a connection with that person?

Data show that 7 out of 10 visitors don’t stick around – they are
there one second and then gone with the wind.

Here is a way to create INSTANTANEOUS engagement that you may not have
known about…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a widget  that’s operates on your site,
prepared to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. It lets you know IMMEDIATELY that they are interested – so
that you can talk to that lead whilst they are really browsing
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads today to see exactly how it operates.

It could be a game-changer for your business – and it gets even
better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead function, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation – instantly (& there’s really a 100X difference
between contacting someone within just 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Additionally then, even if you don’t finalize a deal instantly, you
can connect later on with text messages for new deals, content links,
even just follow up notes to build a relationship.

Everything I have just mentioned is straightforward, easy, and
effective.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to find out what Web Visitors Into
Leads can provide for your business.

You can be turning up to 100X more leads today!

Brendan
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads provides a FREE 14 days trial – and it
even comes with International Long Distance Calls. 
There are customers eager to chat with you right now… don’t leave
them waiting.
