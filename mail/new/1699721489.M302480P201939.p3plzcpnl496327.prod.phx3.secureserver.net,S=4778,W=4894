"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Manager.

This is Charla and I just found your website at
ststephenssanjose.org...

I discovered it after a quick search, so your SEO’s working out…

Information looks pretty good…

One thing’s missing though…

A QUICK, EASY way to get in touch with you IMMEDIATELY.

Because studies show that a web lead like me will only stay a few
seconds – 7 out of 10 disappear almost instantly, Click Browse
Browse… then gone forever.

I have the answer:

Visitor Engagement Widget is a tool that’s operates on your site,
prepared to capture any viewer’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. You will know instantly they’re interested and you can call
them directly to TALK with them - really while they’re still on the
internet looking at your site.

conversation right away… which is so effective, because connecting

offers, content links, even just check-in notes to develop a
relationship.

All I’ve just described is incredibly simple to implement,
cost-effective, and lucrative.
