You have been contacted by Serge Gianchandani, and the message is as
follows.

"Good afternoon, you're reading this letter as we want everyone in our
crypto world and not only to be aware of cooperating with a serial
entrepreneur and professiona SCAMMER called Serge Gianchandani. He
lives in Dehli, India. 
He is CEO (or CPO - his position is also differs in many sources) and
co-founder of Metamall and so called 'serial entrepreneur'. All his
projects are poor and look like scam as soon as it reach listing. 
He stole more than $50,000 from investors by taking the money for the
SAFT and not sending the tokens. 50k$ is only a small part of who we
found, I think the amounts are estimated at millions of dollars. We
have all the proofs of what weâ€™re saying. We can send it to anyone,
just send request to: SCAM.SergeMetamall@gmail.com 
Because we haven't received Metamall tokens we asked for refund and
return of money of our investors. But Serge refused to return 50000
USDT. So we haven't received neither the tokens, nor the invested
money. We where SCAMMED! 
 
His contacts can be found below, we would be grateful if you would
complain about him in social networks. Very soon we will turn down his
website of Metamalls. 
 
You can complain about his website https://www.metamalls.io/ - here:

His companies

Sorry to bother you, but the world will be cleaner without scammers!"
