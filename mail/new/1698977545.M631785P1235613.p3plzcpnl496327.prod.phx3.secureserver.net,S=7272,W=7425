"Cool website!

Hello ststephenssanjose.org Owner.

My name’s Floyd, and I just found your site - ststephenssanjose.org
- while browsing the net. You surfaced at the peak of the search
results, so I checked you out. Appears like what you’re doing is
very cool.  

But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me comes
across ststephenssanjose.org, what usually happens?

Is your site generating leads for your business? 

I’m supposing some, but I also bet you’d like more… studies
demonstrate that 7 out 10 who touch down on a site finish leaving
without a trace.

Not good.

Here’s a idea – what if there was an simple way for every visitor
to “elevate their hand” to get a phone call from you INSTANTLY…
the minute they hit your site and declared, “call me now.”

You can –
  
Web Visitor is a software widget that’s operates on your site, ready
to catch any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.  It
enables you know IMMEDIATELY – so that you can speak to that lead
while they’re really looking your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to experiment with a Live Demo with
Web Visitor now to see specifically how it works.

Time is money when it comes to connecting with leads – the
distinction between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30
minutes later can be massive – like 100 times better!

That’s why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead attribute because
once you’ve captured the visitor’s phone number, you can instantly
a text message (SMS) conversation.
  
Consider the possibilities – even if you don’t close a deal then
and there, you can follow-up with text messages for new offers,
content links, even just “how you doing?” notes to construct a
relationship.

Wouldn’t that be cool?

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/3LPltcD to learn Web Visitor can do for your
enterprise

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
Floyd

PS: Web Visitor offers FREE 14 days trial – and it even comprises
Long Distance Calling. 
You have customers waiting to to talk with you right now… don’t
keep them waiting.
