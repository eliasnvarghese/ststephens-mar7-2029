"Hi to ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster! it's Eric and I ran across
ststephenssanjose.org a little while ago.

Looks great… but now what?

I mean, once someone like myself locates your website – either by a
Search or just bouncing around – what happens next? Do you getting a
lot of leads from your site, or at least enough to make you happy?

Frankly, most business websites come a bit short in terms of it comes
to producing paying customers. Data indicate that 70% of a site’s
visitors vanish and are gone forever  just a moment.

Here is an idea…

What about make it it really EASY for any visitor who comes to get a
personal phone call you as soon as they hit your site…

This is possible –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool  that’s functions on your site,
set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone Number.
It notifies you the moment they let you know they’re interested –
so that you can speak to that lead while they’re actually browsing
your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to check out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to understand exactly how it operates.

You will be astonished - the difference between connecting with
someone within 5 minutes compared to a half-hour or more later can
enhance your results 100-fold.

It becomes even better… after you’ve grabbed their phone number,
with our new SMS Text With Lead capability, you can instantly start a
text (SMS) conversation.

That way, even if you don’t seal a deal immediately, you can keep in
touch with text messages for new offers, content links, even just
“how you doing?” notes to establish a relationship.

Rather sweet – AND effective.

Leads can offer for your business.
