"Salutations ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

I'm Anibal, and I just came across your site ststephenssanjose.org.
It’s has much going for it, but here’s a proposal to make it even
better.

Visitor Engagement Widget – CLICK HERE
https://turboleadgeneration.com for a live demo right now.

Visitor Engagement Widget is a software widget that’s works on your
site, set to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. It notifies you the moment they let you know they’re
interested – so that you can talk to that lead while they’re
really browsing your site.

And once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS Text
With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS)
conversation… and if they don’t take you up on your offer then,
you can follow up with text messages for new offers, content links, or
even just “how you doing?” notes to forge a relationship.

CLICK HERE https://turboleadgeneration.com to learn what Lead
Conversion Tool can do for your business.

The difference between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus a
half-hour means you might be converting up to 100X more leads right
now!

Anibal
PS: Studies show that 70% of a site’s visitors disappear and are
gone forever after just a moment. Don’t keep letting go of them.
Lead Conversion Tool offers a FREE 14 days trial – and it even
includes International Long Distance Calling.
You have customers waiting to talk with you immediately… don’t
keep them waiting.
