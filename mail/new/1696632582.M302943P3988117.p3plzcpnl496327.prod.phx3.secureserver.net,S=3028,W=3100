You have been contacted by Frank Holley, and the message is as
follows.

"Accidental overdose is the #1 cause of death for people aged 18-45 in
the United States.

 

Narcan is a nasal spray that can reverse an opioid overdose, saving
the person’s life.  Our group of volunteers has compiled a website
that tracks organizations that are giving out free and discount
Narcan, this site is  https://www.narcan-finder.com/. 

 

Eventually this life saving medication will be as easy to find as a
fire extinguisher, but at the moment, it’s only gradually becoming
available, and often expensive at drugstores, etc. Would you consider
sharing our resource on your website?  It will save lives.

 

If you have any questions or want to help spread the word, contact us
at narcanfinder@gmail.com. Thank you for your consideration!"
