You have been contacted by Felicia Harrel, and the message is as
follows.

"Salutations ststephenssanjose.org Manager!

My name is Felicia and, contrary to many emails you may get, I wanted
to instead provide you with a word of encouragement – Kudos!

What for?

A portion of my job is to inspect websites and the work you’ve done
with ststephenssanjose.org definitely is remarkable. 

It’s clear you have taken building a website to heart and made a
genuine investment of energy into making it premium.

However, there is, indeed, a question… more precisely, a
question…

So, when someone such as me discovers your site – possibly at the
top of the search results (good job BTW) or just through a random
link, how do you know?

Furthermore, how do you make a bond with that person?

Studies reveal that 7 out of 10 visitors leave – they’re there one
second and then gone with the wind.

There’s a way to create IMMEDIATE engagement that you might not have
known about…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s operates on your
site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and Phone
Number. It lets you know INSTANTLY that they’re interested – so
that you can chat to that lead while they’re literally looking over
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to experience a Live Demo with
Instant Engagement Tool now to see exactly how it works.

It could be a revolutionary change for your business – and it gets
even better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new
SMS Text With Lead feature, you can instantly start a text (SMS)
conversation – instantly (and there’s really a 100X difference
between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Additionally then, even if you don’t close a deal right away, you
can follow up later on with text messages for new offers, content
links, even just follow-up notes to build a relationship.

Everything I’ve just described is simple, easy, and efficient.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to discover what Lead Capture
can do for your business.

You could be converting up to 100X more leads today!
