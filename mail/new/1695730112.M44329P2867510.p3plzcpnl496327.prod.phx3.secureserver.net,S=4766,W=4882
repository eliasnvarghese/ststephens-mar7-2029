You have been contacted by Kassie Dealba, and the message is as
follows.

"Dear ststephenssanjose.org Owner

My name is Kassie and, contrary to many emails you could get, I wanted
to alternatively provide you with a word of encouragement – Well
done!

What for?

A portion of my job is to review websites and the work you’ve done
with ststephenssanjose.org definitely stands out. 

It’s clear you have taken building a website to heart and made a
genuine investment of energy into making it superior.

Nevertheless, there is, indeed, a catch-22… more accurately, a
question…

So, when someone like me stumbles upon your site – possibly at the
peak of the search results (nice job by the way) or just through a
random link, how do you find out?

Furthermore, how do you make a connection with that person?

Studies reveal that 7 out of 10 visitors leave – they’re there one
second and then vanished.

Here’s a way to create INSTANT engagement that you may not have
known about…

Instant Engagement Tool is a software widget that’s functions on
your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address, and
Phone Number. It lets you know INSTANTLY that they’re interested –
so that you can talk to that lead while they’re actually browsing
ststephenssanjose.org.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to try out a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to see precisely how it works.

It can be a game-changer for your business – and it gets even
better… once you’ve captured their phone number, with our new SMS
Text With Lead feature, you can automatically start a text (SMS)
conversation – immediately (and there’s actually a 100X difference
between contacting someone within 5 minutes versus 30 minutes.)

Additionally then, even if you don’t close a deal immediately, you
can reconnect later on with text messages for new offers, content
links, even just follow-up notes to develop a relationship.

Each aspect I’ve just described is simple, easy, and effective.

CLICK HERE http://jumboleadmagnet.com to discover what Web Visitors
Into Leads can do for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more leads today!
