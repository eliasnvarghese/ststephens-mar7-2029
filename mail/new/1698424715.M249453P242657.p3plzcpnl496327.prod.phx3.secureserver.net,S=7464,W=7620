"Hi to ststephenssanjose.org Webmaster!

Awesome website!

 name’s Clarita, and I  discovered your site - ststephenssanjose.org
- when browsing the net. Your site popped up at the very top of the
search engine results, so I checked you out. Seems like what you’re
doing is really interesting.

But if you don’t mind me asking – after someone like me comes
across ststephenssanjose.org, what typically happens?

Is your site produce leads for your business?

I’m thinking a few, but I also assume you’d like more… studies
indicate that 7 out 10 who land on a site wind up leaving without any
interaction.

That's unfortunate.

Here’s a thought – what if there's an effortless way for every
visitor to “raise their hand” to get a phone call from you RIGHT
AWAY… the second they visit your site and expressed, “call me
now.”

Guess what, you can –

Web Visitors Into Leads is a software widget that’s functions on
your site, ready to capture any visitor’s Name, Email address and
Phone Number. It allows you be informed INSTANTLY – so that you can
chat to that lead while they’re really checking out your site.

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to experience a Live Demo with Web
Visitors Into Leads now to understand exactly how it works.

Time is money when it comes to connecting with leads – the
difference between connecting with someone within 5 minutes compared
to 30 minutes later is significant – like 100 times superior!

That’s why we built out our new SMS Text With Lead capability… as
after you’ve collected the visitor’s phone number, you can
instantly start a text message (SMS) conversation.

Imagine about the potential – even if you don’t close a deal then
and there, you can follow up with text messages for fresh promotions,
content links, or even just “how you doing?” notes to create a
relationship.

Wouldn’t that be cool?

CLICK HERE https://bit.ly/LeadGena to discover what Web Visitors Into
Leads can offer for your business.

You might be turning up to 100X more leads right now!
Clarita

PS: Web Visitors Into Leads gives a FREE 14 days trial – and it also
