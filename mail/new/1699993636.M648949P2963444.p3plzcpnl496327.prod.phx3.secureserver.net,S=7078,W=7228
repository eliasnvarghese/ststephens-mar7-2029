"To the ststephenssanjose.org Administrator.

This is Layne here, bringing you a brief message about your website
ststephenssanjose.org...

I’m throughout the internet quite a bit and I see numerous business
websites.

Like yours, a number of them have excellent content.

But, more often than not, they fall short when it comes to connecting
and connecting with someone who visits.

I comprehend – it is difficult. Research indicate 7 out of 10
persons who land on a site, leave it in moments without leaving  a
trace. You’ve got the eyeball, but nothing else.

Here’s a solution for you…

Web Visitors Into Leads is a tool widget that’s functions on your
site, ready to capture every visitor’s Name, Email address and Phone
Number. You’d know immediately they’re interested and you could
call them direct to chat with them actually as they are still on the
web looking at your site.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to try out a Live Demo
with Web Visitors Into Leads today to understand exactly how it
works.

It can be enormous for your business – and since you have got that
phone number, with our new SMS Text With Lead capability, you can
automatically start a text (SMS) discussion – right away… and
contacting someone in that 5 minute window is 100 times more potent
than contacting 30 minutes or more later.

Additionally, with text messaging you may follow up later with new
deals, content links, or even just follow up notes to maintain the
conversation going.

All I have just described is extremely simple to put into action,
affordable, and lucrative.

CLICK HERE https://advanceleadgeneration.com to discover what Web
Visitors Into Leads can provide for your business.

You can be converting up to 100X more eyeballs into leads as we
speak!

Layne
PS: Web Visitors Into Leads gives a FREE 14 days trial – and it
features International Long Distance Calls. 
There are customers waiting to speak with you right now… don’t
leave them waiting.
